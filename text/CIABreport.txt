On the Front Cover

This  was  the  crew  patch  for  STS-107.  The  central  element 
of the patch was the microgravity symbol, µg, flowing into 
the rays of the Astronaut symbol. The orbital inclination was 
portrayed by the 39-degree angle of the Earthʼs horizon to 
the Astronaut symbol. The sunrise was representative of the 
numerous science experiments that were the dawn of a new 
era for continued microgravity research on the International 
Space Station and beyond. The breadth of science conduct-
ed on this mission had widespread benefits to life on Earth 
and the continued exploration of space, illustrated by the 
Earth and stars. The constellation Columba (the dove) was 
chosen to symbolize peace on Earth and the Space Shuttle 
Columbia. In addition, the seven stars represent the STS-107 
crew members, as well as honoring the original Mercury 7 
astronauts who paved the way to make research in space 
possible. The Israeli flag represented the first person from 
that country to fly on the Space Shuttle.

BOARD STATEMENT

For all those who are inspired by flight, and for the nation 
where powered flight was first achieved, the year 2003 had 
long been anticipated as one of celebration – December 17 
would mark the centennial of the day the Wright Flyer first 
took to the air. But 2003 began instead on a note of sudden 
and profound loss. On February 1, Space Shuttle Columbia 
was destroyed in a disaster that claimed the lives of all seven 
of its crew. 

While February 1 was an occasion for mourning, the efforts 
that ensued can be a source of national pride. NASA publicly 
and forthrightly informed the nation about the accident and 
all the associated information that became available. The Co-
lumbia Accident Investigation Board was established within 
two hours of the loss of signal from the returning spacecraft 
in accordance with procedures established by NASA follow-
ing the Challenger accident 17 years earlier.

The crew members lost that morning were explorers in the 
finest tradition, and since then, everyone associated with the 
Board has felt that we were laboring in their legacy. Ours, too, 
was a journey of discovery: We sought to discover the con-
ditions that produced this tragic outcome and to share those 
lessons in such a way that this nationʼs space program will 
emerge  stronger  and  more  sure-footed.  If  those  lessons  are 
truly learned, then Columbiaʼs crew will have made an indel-
ible contribution to the endeavor each one valued so greatly.

After nearly seven months of investigation, the Board has 
been able to arrive at findings and recommendations aimed 
at  significantly  reducing  the  chances  of  further  accidents. 
Our  aim  has  been  to  improve  Shuttle  safety  by  multiple 
means,  not  just  by  correcting  the  specific  faults  that  cost 
the nation this Orbiter and this crew. With that intent, the 
Board conducted not only an investigation of what happened 
to Columbia, but also – to determine the conditions that al-
lowed the accident to occur – a safety evaluation of the en-
tire Space Shuttle Program. Most of the Boardʼs efforts were 
undertaken in a completely open manner. By necessity, the 
safety evaluation was conducted partially out of the public 
view,  since it included frank,  off-the-record statements by 
a substantial number of people connected with the Shuttle 
program.

In order to understand the findings and recommendations in 
this report, it is important to appreciate the way the Board 
looked at this accident. It is our view that complex systems 
almost always fail in complex ways, and we believe it would 
be wrong to reduce the complexities and weaknesses asso-
ciated with these systems to some simple explanation. Too 
often,  accident  investigations  blame  a  failure  only  on  the 
last step in a complex process, when a more comprehensive 
understanding of that process could reveal that earlier steps 
might  be  equally  or  even  more  culpable.  In  this  Boardʼs 
opinion,  unless  the  technical,  organizational,  and  cultural 
recommendations made in this report are implemented, little 
will have been accomplished to lessen the chance that an-
other accident will follow.

From its inception, the Board has considered itself an inde-
pendent and public institution, accountable to the American 
public, the White House, Congress, the astronaut corps and 
their families, and NASA. With the support of these constitu-
ents, the Board resolved to broaden the scope of the accident 
investigation  into  a  far-reaching  examination  of  NASAʼs 
operation of the Shuttle fleet. We have explored the impact 
of  NASAʼs  organizational  history  and  practices  on  Shuttle 
safety, as well as the roles of public expectations and national 
policy-making.

In this process, the Board identified a number of pertinent 
factors, which we have grouped into three distinct categories: 
1) physical failures that led directly to Columbiaʼs destruc-
tion;  2)  underlying  weaknesses,  revealed  in  NASAʼs  orga-
nization and history, that can pave the way to catastrophic 
failure; and 3) “other significant observations” made during 
the course of the investigation, but which may be unrelated 
to the accident at hand. Left uncorrected, any of these factors 
could contribute to future Shuttle losses. 

To establish the credibility of its findings and recommenda-
tions, the Board grounded its examinations in rigorous sci-
entific and engineering principles. We have consulted with 
leading authorities not only in mechanical systems, but also 
in organizational theory and practice. These authoritiesʼ areas 
of expertise included risk management, safety engineering, 
and a review of “best business practices” employed by other 
high-risk,  but  apparently  reliable  enterprises. Among  these 
are  nuclear  power  plants,  petrochemical  facilities,  nuclear 
weapons production, nuclear submarine operations, and ex-
pendable space launch systems.

NASA  is  a  federal  agency  like  no  other.  Its  mission  is 
unique, and its stunning technological accomplishments, a 
source of pride and inspiration without equal, represent the 
best in American skill and courage. At times NASAʼs efforts 
have riveted the nation, and it is never far from public view 
and close scrutiny from many quarters. The loss of Columbia 
and her crew represents a turning point, calling for a renewed 
public  policy  debate  and  commitment  regarding  human 
space exploration. One of our goals has been to set forth the 
terms for this debate.

Named  for  a  sloop  that  was  the  first  American  vessel  to 
circumnavigate the Earth more than 200 years ago, in 1981 
Columbia became the first spacecraft of its type to fly in Earth 
orbit and successfully completed 27 missions over more than 
two decades. During the STS-107 mission, Columbia and its 
crew traveled more than six million miles in 16 days. 

The Orbiterʼs destruction, just 16 minutes before scheduled 
touchdown, shows that space flight is still far from routine. 
It  involves  a  substantial  element  of  risk,  which  must  be 
recognized, but never accepted with resignation. The seven 
Columbia  astronauts  believed  that  the  risk  was  worth  the 
reward. The Board salutes their courage and dedicates this 
report to their memory.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Columbia Accident Investigation Boardʼs independent 
investigation  into  the  February  1,  2003,  loss  of  the  Space 
Shuttle Columbia and its seven-member crew lasted nearly 
seven months. A staff of more than 120, along with some 400 
NASA engineers, supported the Boardʼs 13 members. Inves-
tigators examined more than 30,000 documents, conducted 
more  than  200  formal  interviews,  heard  testimony  from 
dozens of expert witnesses, and reviewed more than 3,000 
inputs from the general public. In addition, more than 25,000 
searchers combed vast stretches of the Western United States 
to retrieve the spacecraftʼs debris. In the process, Columbiaʼs 
tragedy was compounded when two debris searchers with the 
U.S. Forest Service perished in a helicopter accident. 

The Board recognized early on that the accident was prob-
ably not an anomalous, random event, but rather likely root-
ed to some degree in NASAʼs history and the human space 
flight programʼs culture. Accordingly, the Board broadened 
its mandate at the outset to include an investigation of a wide 
range of historical and organizational issues, including polit-
ical and budgetary considerations, compromises, and chang-
ing priorities over the life of the Space Shuttle Program. The 
Boardʼs conviction regarding the importance of these factors 
strengthened as the investigation progressed, with the result 
that this report, in its findings, conclusions, and recommen-
dations, places as much weight on these causal factors as on 
the more easily understood and corrected physical cause of 
the accident.

The physical cause of the loss of Columbia and its crew was 
a breach in the Thermal Protection System on the leading 
edge of the left wing, caused by a piece of insulating foam 
which  separated  from  the  left  bipod  ramp  section  of  the 
External Tank at 81.7 seconds after launch, and struck the 
wing in the vicinity of the lower half of Reinforced Carbon-
Carbon panel number 8. During re-entry this breach in the 
Thermal Protection System allowed superheated air to pen-
etrate through the leading edge insulation and progressively 
melt the aluminum structure of the left wing, resulting in 
a weakening of the structure until increasing aerodynamic 
forces caused loss of control, failure of the wing, and break-
up of the Orbiter. This breakup occurred in a flight regime in 
which, given the current design of the Orbiter, there was no 
possibility for the crew to survive.

The organizational causes of this accident are rooted in the 
Space  Shuttle  Programʼs  history  and  culture, including  the 
original compromises that were required to gain approval for 
the Shuttle, subsequent years of resource constraints, fluc-
tuating priorities, schedule pressures, mischaracterization of 
the Shuttle as operational rather than developmental, and lack 
of an agreed national vision for human space flight. Cultural 
traits and organizational practices detrimental to safety were 
allowed to develop, including: reliance on past success as a 
substitute for sound engineering practices (such as testing to 
understand why systems were not performing in accordance 
with  requirements);  organizational  barriers  that  prevented 
effective  communication  of  critical  safety  information  and 

stifled professional differences of opinion; lack of integrated 
management across program elements; and the evolution of 
an  informal  chain  of  command  and  decision-making  pro-
cesses that operated outside the organizationʼs rules.

This report discusses the attributes of an organization that 
could more safely and reliably operate the inherently risky 
Space Shuttle, but does not provide a detailed organizational 
prescription. Among  those  attributes  are:  a  robust  and  in-
dependent  program  technical  authority  that  has  complete 
control  over  specifications  and  requirements,  and  waivers 
to them; an independent safety assurance organization with 
line authority over all levels of safety oversight; and an or-
ganizational culture that reflects the best characteristics of a 
learning organization.
 
This  report  concludes  with  recommendations,  some  of 
which  are  specifically  identified  and  prefaced  as  “before 
return to flight.” These recommendations are largely related 
to the physical cause of the accident, and include prevent-
ing the loss of foam, improved imaging of the Space Shuttle 
stack from liftoff through separation of the External Tank, 
and on-orbit inspection and repair of the Thermal Protec-
tion System. The remaining recommendations, for the most 
part,  stem  from  the  Boardʼs  findings  on  organizational 
cause factors. While they are not “before return to flight” 
recommendations, they can be viewed as “continuing to fly” 
recommendations, as they capture the Boardʼs thinking on 
what changes are necessary to operate the Shuttle and future 
spacecraft safely in the mid- to long-term. 

These recommendations reflect both the Boardʼs strong sup-
port for return to flight at the earliest date consistent with the 
overriding objective of safety, and the Boardʼs conviction 
that operation of the Space Shuttle, and all human space-
flight, is a developmental activity with high inherent risks.

REPORT SYNOPSIS

The Columbia Accident Investigation Boardʼs independent 
investigation  into  the  tragic  February  1,  2003,  loss  of  the 
Space Shuttle Columbia and its seven-member crew lasted 
nearly  seven  months  and  involved  13  Board  members, 
approximately  120  Board  investigators,  and  thousands 
of  NASA  and  support  personnel.  Because  the  events  that 
initiated  the  accident  were  not  apparent  for  some  time, 
the  investigationʼs  depth  and  breadth  were  unprecedented 
in  NASA  history.  Further,  the  Board  determined  early  in 
the  investigation  that  it  intended  to  put  this  accident  into 
context. We considered it unlikely that the accident was a 
random event; rather, it was likely related in some degree 
to  NASAʼs  budgets,  history,  and  program  culture,  as  well 
as to the politics, compromises, and changing priorities of 
the democratic process. We are convinced that the manage-
ment practices overseeing the Space Shuttle Program were 
as much a cause of the accident as the foam that struck the 
left  wing.  The  Board  was  also  influenced  by  discussions 
with members of Congress, who suggested that this nation 
needed a broad examination of NASAʼs Human Space Flight 
Program, rather than just an investigation into what physical 
fault caused Columbia to break up during re-entry. 

Findings and recommendations are in the relevant chapters 
and all recommendations are compiled in Chapter 11.

Volume I is organized into four parts: The Accident; Why 
the Accident Occurred; A Look Ahead; and various appendi-
ces. To put this accident in context, Parts One and Two begin 
with histories, after which the accident is described and then 
analyzed,  leading  to  findings  and  recommendations.  Part 
Three contains the Boardʼs views on what is needed to im-
prove the safety of our voyage into space. Part Four is refer-
ence material. In addition to this first volume, there will be 
subsequent volumes that contain technical reports generated 
by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and NASA, 
as well as volumes containing reference documentation and 
other related material. 
PART ONE: THE ACCIDENT

Chapter 1 relates the history of the Space Shuttle Program 
before the Challenger accident. With the end looming for 
the Apollo  moon  exploration  program,  NASA  unsuccess-
fully  attempted  to  get  approval  for  an  equally  ambitious 
(and  expensive)  space  exploration  program.  Most  of  the 
proposed programs started with space stations in low-Earth 
orbit  and  included  a  reliable,  economical,  medium-lift 
vehicle to travel safely to and from low-Earth orbit. After 
many  failed  attempts,  and  finally  agreeing  to  what  would 
be untenable compromises, NASA gained approval from the 
Nixon Administration to develop, on a fixed budget, only 
the transport vehicle. Because the Administration did not ap-
prove a low-Earth-orbit station, NASA had to create a mis-
sion for the vehicle. To satisfy the Administrationʼs require-
ment that the system be economically justifiable, the vehicle 
had to capture essentially all space launch business, and to 
do  that,  it  had  to  meet  wide-ranging  requirements.  These 

sometimes-competing  requirements  resulted  in  a  compro-
mise vehicle that was less than optimal for manned flights. 
NASA designed and developed a remarkably capable and 
resilient vehicle, consisting of an Orbiter with three Main 
Engines, two Solid Rocket Boosters, and an External Tank, 
but one that has never met any of its original requirements 
for reliability, cost, ease of turnaround, maintainability, or, 
regrettably, safety. 

Chapter  2  documents  the  final  flight  of  Columbia.  As  a 
straightforward record of the event, it contains no findings or 
recommendations. Designated STS-107, this was the Space 
Shuttle  Programʼs  113th  flight  and  Columbiaʼs  28th.  The 
flight was close to trouble-free. Unfortunately, there were no 
indications to either the crew onboard Columbia or to engi-
neers in Mission Control that the mission was in trouble as 
a result of a foam strike during ascent. Mission management 
failed to detect weak signals that the Orbiter was in trouble 
and take corrective action.

Columbia was the first space-rated Orbiter. It made the Space 
Shuttle Programʼs first four orbital test flights. Because it was 
the first of its kind, Columbia differed slightly from Orbiters 
Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. Built to an 
earlier engineering standard, Columbia was slightly heavier, 
and, although it could reach the high-inclination orbit of the 
International Space Station, its payload was insufficient to 
make  Columbia  cost-effective  for  Space  Station  missions. 
Therefore, Columbia was not equipped with a Space Station 
docking system, which freed up space in the payload bay for 
longer  cargos,  such  as  the  science  modules  Spacelab  and 
SPACEHAB.  Consequently,  Columbia  generally  flew  sci-
ence missions and serviced the Hubble Space Telescope.

STS-107 was an intense science mission that required the 
seven-member  crew  to  form  two  teams,  enabling  round-
the-clock  shifts.  Because  the  extensive  science  cargo  and 
its extra power sources required additional checkout time, 
the  launch  sequence  and  countdown  were  about  24  hours 
longer than normal. Nevertheless, the countdown proceeded 
as planned, and Columbia was launched from Launch Com-
plex 39-A on January 16, 2003, at 10:39 a.m. Eastern Stan-
dard Time (EST). 

At 81.7 seconds after launch, when the Shuttle was at about 
65,600 feet and traveling at Mach 2.46 (1,650 mph), a large 
piece  of  hand-crafted  insulating  foam  came  off  an  area 
where  the  Orbiter  attaches  to  the  External  Tank. At  81.9 
seconds, it struck the leading edge of Columbiaʼs left wing. 
This event was not detected by the crew on board or seen 
by ground support teams until the next day, during detailed 
reviews of all launch camera photography and videos. This 
foam strike had no apparent effect on the daily conduct of 
the 16-day mission, which met all its objectives.

The  de-orbit  burn  to  slow  Columbia  down  for  re-entry 
into Earthʼs atmosphere was normal, and the flight profile 
throughout re-entry was standard. Time during re-entry is

measured in seconds from “Entry Interface,” an arbitrarily 
determined altitude of 400,000 feet where the Orbiter be-
gins to experience the effects of Earthʼs atmosphere. Entry 
Interface for STS-107 occurred at 8:44:09 a.m. on February 
1. Unknown to the crew or ground personnel, because the 
data is recorded and stored in the Orbiter instead of being 
transmitted to Mission Control at Johnson Space Center, the 
first abnormal indication occurred 270 seconds after Entry 
Interface. Chapter 2 reconstructs in detail the events lead-
ing to the loss of Columbia and her crew, and refers to more 
details in the appendices. 

In Chapter 3, the Board analyzes all the information avail-
able to conclude that the direct, physical action that initiated 
the chain of events leading to the loss of Columbia and her 
crew  was  the  foam  strike  during  ascent.  This  chapter  re-
views five analytical paths – aerodynamic, thermodynamic, 
sensor  data  timeline,  debris  reconstruction,  and  imaging 
evidence – to show that all five independently arrive at the 
same conclusion. The subsequent impact testing conducted 
by the Board is also discussed.

That conclusion is that Columbia re-entered Earthʼs atmo-
sphere with a pre-existing breach in the leading edge of its 
left wing in the vicinity of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) 
panel 8. This breach, caused by the foam strike on ascent, 
was of sufficient size to allow superheated air (probably ex-
ceeding 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit) to penetrate the cavity be-
hind the RCC panel. The breach widened, destroying the in-
sulation protecting the wingʼs leading edge support structure, 
and the superheated air eventually melted the thin aluminum 
wing spar. Once in the interior, the superheated air began to 
destroy the left wing. This destructive process was carefully 
reconstructed from the recordings of hundreds of sensors in-
side the wing, and from analyses of the reactions of the flight 
control systems to the changes in aerodynamic forces.

By the time Columbia passed over the coast of California 
in the pre-dawn hours of February 1, at Entry Interface plus 
555 seconds, amateur videos show that pieces of the Orbiter 
were shedding. The Orbiter was captured on videotape dur-
ing most of its quick transit over the Western United States. 
The  Board  correlated  the  events  seen  in  these  videos  to 
sensor  readings  recorded  during  re-entry.  Analysis  indi-
cates that the Orbiter continued to fly its pre-planned flight 
profile, although, still unknown to anyone on the ground or 
aboard Columbia, her control systems were working furi-
ously to maintain that flight profile. Finally, over Texas, just 
southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth, the increasing aerodynamic 
forces the Orbiter experienced in the denser levels of the at-
mosphere overcame the catastrophically damaged left wing, 
causing the Orbiter to fall out of control at speeds in excess 
of 10,000 mph.

The chapter details the recovery of about 38 percent of the 
Orbiter  (some  84,000  pieces)  and  the  reconstruction  and 
analysis of this debris. It presents findings and recommenda-
tions to make future Space Shuttle operations safer.

Chapter  4  describes  the  investigation  into  other  possible 
physical factors that may have contributed to the accident. 
The chapter opens with the methodology of the fault tree 

analysis, which is an engineering tool for identifying every 
conceivable fault, then determining whether that fault could 
have caused the system in question to fail. In all, more than 
3,000  individual  elements  in  the  Columbia  accident  fault 
tree were examined.

In addition, the Board analyzed the more plausible fault sce-
narios, including the impact of space weather, collisions with 
micrometeoroids or “space junk,” willful damage, flight crew 
performance, and failure of some critical Shuttle hardware. 
The Board concludes in Chapter 4 that despite certain fault 
tree exceptions left “open” because they cannot be conclu-
sively disproved, none of these factors caused or contributed 
to the accident. This chapter also contains findings and rec-
ommendations to make Space Shuttle operations safer.
PART TWO: WHY THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED

Part Two, “Why the Accident Occurred,” examines NASAʼs 
organizational,  historical,  and  cultural  factors,  as  well  as 
how these factors contributed to the accident.

As  in  Part  One,  Part  Two  begins  with  history.  Chapter  5 
examines  the  post-Challenger  history  of  NASA  and  its 
Human Space Flight Program. A summary of the relevant 
portions of the Challenger investigation recommendations 
is presented, followed by a review of NASA budgets to indi-
cate how committed the nation is to supporting human space 
flight,  and  within  the  NASA  budget  we  look  at  how  the 
Space Shuttle Program has fared. Next, organizational and 
management history, such as shifting management systems 
and locations, are reviewed. 

Chapter 6 documents management performance related to 
Columbia to establish events analyzed in later chapters. The 
chapter begins with a review of the history of foam strikes on 
the Orbiter to determine how Space Shuttle Program managers 
rationalized  the  danger  from  repeated  strikes  on  the  Or-
biterʼs Thermal Protection System. Next is an explanation 
of the intense pressure the program was under to stay on 
schedule, driven largely by the self-imposed requirement to 
complete the International Space Station. Chapter 6 then re-
lates in detail the effort by some NASA engineers to obtain 
additional imagery of Columbia to determine if the foam 
strike had damaged the Orbiter, and how management dealt 
with that effort. 

In Chapter 7, the Board presents its view that NASAʼs or-
ganizational culture had as much to do with this accident 
as  foam  did.  By  examining  safety  history,  organizational 
theory, best business practices, and current safety failures, 
the report notes that only significant structural changes to 
NASAʼs organizational curlture will enable it to succeed. 

This  chapter  measures  the  Shuttle  Programʼs  practices 
against this organizational context and finds them wanting. 
The  Board  concludes  that  NASAʼs  current  organization 
does not provide effective checks and balances, does not 
have  an  independant  safety  program,  and  has  not  dem-
onstrated  the  characteristics  of  a  learning  organization. 
Chapter  7  provides  recommendations  for  adjustments  in 
organizational culture.

Chapter  8,  the  final  chapter  in  Part  Two,  draws  from  the 
previous chapters on history, budgets, culture, organization, 
and safety practices, and analyzes how all these factors con-
tributed to this accident. The chapter opens with “echoes of 
Challenger” that compares the two accidents. This chapter 
captures the Boardʼs views of the need to adjust manage-
ment to enhance safety margins in Shuttle operations, and 
reaffirms the Boardʼs position that without these changes, 
we have no confidence that other “corrective actions” will 
improve the safety of Shuttle operations. The changes we 
recommend  will  be  difficult  to  accomplish  –  and  will  be 
internally resisted. 
PART THREE: A LOOK AHEAD

Part  Three  summarizes  the  Boardʼs  conclusions  on  what 
needs  to  be  done  to  resume  our  journey  into  space,  lists 
significant observations the Board made that are unrelated 
to the accident but should be recorded, and provides a sum-
mary of the Boardʼs recommendations.

In Chapter 9, the Board first reviews its short-term recom-
mendations. These return-to-flight recommendations are the 
minimum that must be done to essentially fix the problems 
that were identified by this accident. Next, the report dis-
cusses what needs to be done to operate the Shuttle in the 
mid-term, 3 to 15 years. Based on NASAʼs history of ignor-
ing  external  recommendations,  or  making  improvements 
that atrophy with time, the Board has no confidence that the 
Space Shuttle can be safely operated for more than a few 
years based solely on renewed post-accident vigilance. 

Chapter 9 then outlines the management system changes the 
Board feels are necessary to safely operate the Shuttle in the 
mid-term. These changes separate the management of sched-
uling  and  budgets  from  technical  specification  authority, 
build a capability of systems integration, and establish and 
provide the resources for an independent safety and mission 
assurance  organization  that  has  supervisory  authority.  The 
third part of the chapter discusses the poor record this na-
tion has, in the Boardʼs view, of developing either a comple-
ment to or a replacement for the Space Shuttle. The report is 
critical of several bodies in the U.S. government that share 
responsibility for this situation, and expresses an opinion on 
how to proceed from here, but does not suggest what the next 
vehicle should look like.

Chapter  10  contains  findings,  observations,  and  recom-
mendations that the Board developed over the course of this 
extensive  investigation  that  are  not  directly  related  to  the 
accident but should prove helpful to NASA.

Chapter 11 is a compilation of all the recommendations in 
the previous chapters.
PART FOUR: APPENDICES

Part  Four  of  the  report  by  the  Columbia Accident  Inves-
tigation  Board  contains  material  relevant  to  this  volume 
organized  in  appendices. Additional,  stand-alone  volumes 
will contain more reference, background, and analysis ma-
terials.

This Earth view of the Sinai Peninsula, Red Sea, Egypt, Nile River, 
and the Mediterranean was taken from Columbia during STS-107.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE

The  Space  Shuttle  is  one  of  the  most  complex  machines  ever 
devised.  Its  main  elements  –  the  Orbiter,  Space  Shuttle  Main 
Engines, External Tank, and Solid Rocket Boosters – are assembled 
from more than 2.5 million parts, 230 miles of wire, 1,060 valves, 
and  1,440  circuit  breakers. Weighing  approximately  4.5  million-
pounds  at  launch,  the  Space  Shuttle  accelerates  to  an  orbital 
velocity of 17,500 miles per hour – 25 times faster than the speed 
of sound – in just over eight minutes. Once on orbit, the Orbiter 
must  protect  its  crew  from  the  vacuum  of  space  while  enabling 
astronauts  to  conduct  scientific  research,  deploy  and  service 
satellites, and assemble the International Space Station. At the end 
of its mission, the Shuttle uses the Earthʼs atmosphere as a brake to 
decelerate from orbital velocity to a safe landing at 220 miles per 
hour, dissipating in the process all the energy it gained on its way 
into orbit.
THE ORBITER

The Orbiter is what is popularly referred to as “the Space Shuttle.” 
About the size of a small commercial airliner, the Orbiter normally 
carries a crew of seven, including a Commander, Pilot, and five 
Mission  or  Payload  Specialists. The  Orbiter  can  accommodate  a 
payload  the  size  of  a  school  bus  weighing  between  38,000  and 
56,300  pounds  depending  on  what  orbit  it  is  launched  into.  The 
Orbiterʼs upper flight deck is filled with equipment for flying and 
maneuvering  the  vehicle  and  controlling  its  remote  manipulator 
arm. The mid-deck contains stowage lockers for food, equipment, 
supplies, and experiments, as well as a toilet, a hatch for entering 
and exiting the vehicle on the ground, and – in some instances – an 
airlock for doing so in orbit. During liftoff and landing, four crew 
members sit on the flight deck and the rest on the mid-deck. 

Different parts of the Orbiter are subjected to dramatically different 
temperatures  during  re-entry.  The  nose  and  leading  edges  of  the 
wings are exposed to superheated air temperatures of 2,800 to 3,000 
degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon re-entry profile. Other portions 
of the wing and fuselage can reach 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Still 
other  areas  on  top  of  the  fuselage  are  sufficiently  shielded  from 
superheated air that ice sometimes survives through landing.

To protect its thin aluminum structure during re-entry, the Orbiter 
is  covered  with  various  materials  collectively  referred  to  as  the 
Thermal  Protection  System.  The  three  major  components  of  the 
system are various types of heat-resistant tiles, blankets, and the 
Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels on the leading edge of 
the wing and nose cap. The RCC panels most closely resemble a 
hi-tech fiberglass – layers of special graphite cloth that are molded 

to  the  desired  shape  at  very  high  temperatures. The  tiles,  which 
protect  most  other  areas  of  the  Orbiter  exposed  to  medium  and 
high heating, are 90 percent air and 10 percent silica (similar to 
common  sand).  One-tenth  the  weight  of  ablative  heat  shields, 
which are designed to erode during re-entry and therefore can only 
be used once, the Shuttleʼs tiles are reusable. They come in varying 
strengths and sizes, depending on which area of the Orbiter they 
protect, and are designed to withstand either 1,200 or 2,300 degrees 
Fahrenheit. In a dramatic demonstration of how little heat the tiles 
transfer, one can place a blowtorch on one side of a tile and a bare 
hand  on  the  other.  The  blankets,  capable  of  withstanding  either 
700 or 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, cover regions of the Orbiter that 
experience only moderate heating.
SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINES

Each Orbiter has three main engines mounted at the aft fuselage. 
These  engines  use  the  most  efficient  propellants  in  the  world 
– oxygen and hydrogen – at a rate of half a ton per second. At 100 
percent  power,  each  engine  produces  375,000  pounds  of  thrust, 
four times that of the largest engine on commercial jets. The large 
bell-shaped nozzle on each engine can swivel 10.5 degrees up and 
down  and  8.5  degrees  left  and  right  to  provide  steering  control 
during ascent. 
EXTERNAL TANK

The three main engines burn propellant at a rate that would drain 
an  average-size  swimming  pool  in  20  seconds.  The  External 
Tank accommodates up to 143,351 gallons of liquid oxygen and 
385,265 gallons of liquid hydrogen. In order to keep the super-cold 
propellants from boiling and to prevent ice from forming on the 
outside of the tank while it is sitting on the launch pad, the External 
Tank is covered with a one-inch-thick coating of insulating foam. 
This insulation is so effective that the surface of the External Tank 
feels only slightly cool to the touch, even though the liquid oxygen 
is  stored  at  minus  297  degrees  Fahrenheit  and  liquid  hydrogen 
at  minus  423  degrees  Fahrenheit.  This  insulating  foam  also 
protects the tankʼs aluminum structure from aerodynamic heating 
during  ascent.  Although  generally  considered  the  least  complex 
of the Shuttleʼs main components, in fact the External Tank is a 
remarkable engineering achievement. In addition to holding over 
1.5 million pounds of cryogenic propellants, the 153.8-foot long 
tank must support the weight of the Orbiter while on the launch pad 
and absorb the 7.3 million pounds of thrust generated by the Solid 
Rocket Boosters and Space Shuttle Main Engines during launch and 
ascent. The External Tanks are manufactured in a plant near New

THE SHUTTLE STACK

The first step in assembling a Space Shuttle for launch is stacking 
the  Solid  Rocket  Booster  segments  on  the  Mobile  Launch 
Platform.  Eight  large  hold-down  bolts  at  the  base  of  the  Solid 
Rocket Boosters will bear the weight of the entire Space Shuttle 
stack  while  it  awaits  launch.  The  External  Tank  is  attached  to 
the Solid Rocket Boosters, and the Orbiter is then attached to the 
External Tank at three points – two at its bottom and a “bipod” 
attachment near the nose. When the vehicle is ready to move out of 
the Vehicle Assembly Building, a Crawler-Transporter picks up the 
entire Mobile Launch Platform and carries it – at one mile per hour 
– to one of the two launch pads.

Orleans and are transported by barge to the Kennedy Space Center 
in Florida. Unlike the Solid Rocket Boosters, which are reused, the 
External Tank is discarded during each mission, burning up in the 
Earthʼs atmosphere after being jettisoned from the Orbiter.
SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS

Despite their power, the Space Shuttle Main Engines alone are not 
sufficient to boost the vehicle to orbit – in fact, they provide only 15 
percent of the necessary thrust. Two Solid Rocket Boosters attached 
to the External Tank generate the remaining 85 percent. Together, 
these two 149-foot long motors produce over six million pounds of 
thrust. The largest solid propellant rockets ever flown, these motors 
use an aluminum powder fuel and ammonium perchlorate oxidizer 
in a binder that has the feel and consistency of a pencil eraser.
 

A Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Demonstration Motor being tested 
near Brigham City, Utah.

Each of the Solid Rocket Boosters consists of 11 separate segments 
joined together. The joints between the segments were extensively 
redesigned after the Challenger accident, which occurred when hot 
gases burned through an O-ring and seal in the aft joint on the left 
Solid Rocket Booster. The motor segments are shipped from their 
manufacturer in Utah and assembled at the Kennedy Space Center. 
Once  assembled,  each  Solid  Rocket  Booster  is  connected  to  the 
External Tank by bolts weighing 65 pounds each. After the Solid 
Rocket  Boosters  burn  for  just  over  two  minutes,  these  bolts  are 
separated by pyrotechnic charges and small rockets then push the 
Solid Rocket Boosters safely away from the rest of the vehicle. As 
the boosters fall back to Earth, parachutes in their nosecones deploy. 
After splashing down into the ocean 120 miles downrange from the 
launch pad, they are recovered for refurbishment and reuse.

AN INTRODUCTION TO NASA

“An Act to provide for research into the problems of flight within 
and outside the Earthʼs atmosphere, and for other purposes.” With 
this simple preamble, the Congress and the President of the United 
States created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) on October 1, 1958. Formed in response to the launch of 
Sputnik by the Soviet Union, NASA inherited the research-oriented 
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and several 
other  government  organizations,  and  almost  immediately  began 
working  on  options  for  manned  space  flight.  NASAʼs  first  high 
profile program was Project Mercury, an early effort to learn if hu-
mans could survive in space. Project Gemini followed with a more 
complex series of experiments to increase manʼs time in space and 
validate advanced concepts such as rendezvous. The efforts con-
tinued with Project Apollo, culminating in 1969 when Apollo 11 
landed the first humans on the Moon. The return from orbit on July 
24, 1975, of the crew from the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project began 
a six-year hiatus of American manned space flight. The launch of 
the first Space Shuttle in April 1981 brought Americans back into 
space, continuing today with the assembly and initial operations of 
the International Space Station. 

In addition to the human space flight program, NASA also main-
tains  an  active  (if  small)  aeronautics  research  program,  a  space 
science program (including deep space and interplanetary explora-
tion), and an Earth observation program. The agency also conducts 
basic research activities in a variety of fields.

NASA, like many federal agencies, is a heavily matrixed organiza-
tion, meaning that the lines of authority are not necessarily straight-
forward. At the simplest level, there are three major types of entities 
involved in the Human Space Flight Program: NASA field centers, 
NASA  programs  carried  out  at  those  centers,  and  industrial  and 
academic contractors. The centers provide the buildings, facilities, 
and support services for the various programs. The programs, along 
with field centers and Headquarters, hire civil servants and contrac-
tors from the private sector to support aspects of their enterprises.

THE LOCATIONS

NASA Headquarters, located in Washington D.C., is responsible for 
leadership and management across five strategic enterprises: Aero-
space Technology, Biological and Physical Research, Earth Science, 
Space Science, and Human Exploration and Development of Space. 
NASA  Headquarters  also  provides  strategic  management  for  the 
Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs. 

The Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, was established in 
1961 as the Manned Spacecraft Center and has led the development 
of every U.S. manned space flight program. Currently, Johnson is 
home to both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station Pro-
gram Offices. The facilities at Johnson include the training, simula-
tion, and mission control centers for the Space Shuttle and Space 
Station. Johnson also has flight operations at Ellington Field, where 
the training aircraft for the astronauts and support aircraft for the 
Space Shuttle Program are stationed, and manages the White Sands 
Test Facility, New Mexico, where hazardous testing is conducted.

The Kennedy Space Center was created to launch the Apollo mis-
sions to the Moon, and currently provides launch and landing facili-
ties for the Space Shuttle. The Center is located on Merritt Island, 
Florida, adjacent to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that also 
provides support for the Space Shuttle Program (and was the site 
of  the  earlier  Mercury  and  Gemini  launches).  Personnel  at  Ken-
nedy support maintenance and overhaul services for the Orbiters, 
assemble and check-out the integrated vehicle prior to launch, and 
operate the Space Station Processing Facility where components of 
the orbiting laboratory are packaged for launch aboard the Space 
Shuttle. The majority of contractor personnel assigned to Kennedy 
are part of the Space Flight Operations Contract administered by 
the Space Shuttle Program Office at Johnson.

The  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center,  near  Hunstville,  Alabama,  is 
home to most NASA rocket propulsion efforts. The Space Shuttle 
Projects  Office  located  at 
Marshall—organization-
ally  part  of 
the  Space 
Shuttle  Program  Office 
at  Johnson—manages  the 
manufacturing and support 
contracts  to  Boeing  Rock-
etdyne for the Space Shut-
tle  Main  Engine  (SSME), 
to Lockheed Martin for the 
External Tank (ET), and to 
ATK  Thiokol  Propulsion 
for 
the  Reusable  Solid 
Rocket Motor (RSRM, the 
major  piece  of  the  Solid 
Rocket  Booster).  Marshall 
is  also  involved  in  micro-
gravity research and space 
product  development  pro-
grams that fly as payloads 
on the Space Shuttle.

The  Stennis  Space  Center 
in  Bay  St.  Louis,  Missis-
sippi,  is  the largest  rocket 
propulsion test complex in 
the  United  States.  Stennis 
provides  all  of  the  testing 
the  Space 
facilities  for

aeronautical research roots to become 
a Center of Excellence for information 
technology. The Centerʼs primary im-
portance to the Space Shuttle Program, 
however, lies in wind tunnel and arc-jet 
testing, and the development of thermal 
protection system concepts.

The Langley Research Center, at Hamp-
ton,  Virginia,  is  the  agencyʼs  primary

the Space Shuttle. To accomplish these 
tasks,  the  program  maintains  large 
workforces at the various NASA Cen-
ters that host the facilities used by the program. The Space Shuttle 
Program Office is also responsible for managing the Space Flight 
Operations Contract with United Space Alliance that provides most 
of the contractor support at Johnson and Kennedy, as well as a small 
amount at Marshall. 
THE CONTRACTORS

The Space Shuttle Program employs a wide variety of commercial 
companies to provide services and products. Among these are some 
of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the country, in-
cluding (but not limited to):

United Space Alliance
This is a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that 
was  established  in  1996  to  perform  the  Space  Flight  Operations 
Contract that essentially conducts the day-to-day operation of the 
Space Shuttle. United Space Alliance is headquartered in Houston, 
Texas, and employs more than 10,000 people at Johnson, Kennedy, 
and Marshall. Its contract currently runs through 2005.

The Boeing Company, NASA Systems
The  Space  Shuttle  Orbiter  was  designed  and  manufactured  by 
Rockwell International, located primarily in Downey and Palmdale, 
California. In 1996, The Boeing Company purchased the aerospace 
assets of Rockwell International, and later moved the Downey op-
eration to Huntington Beach, California, as part of a consolidation 
of facilities. Boeing is subcontracted to United Space Alliance to 
provide support to Orbiter modifications and operations, with work 
performed in California, and at Johnson and Kennedy. 

The Boeing Company, Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power
The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International was responsi-
ble for the development and manufacture of the Space Shuttle Main 
Engines, and continues to support the engines as a part of The Boe-
ing Company. The Space Shuttle Projects Office at Marshall man-
ages the main engines contract, with most of the work performed in 
California, Stennis, and Kennedy.

ATK Thiokol Propulsion
ATK Thiokol  Propulsion  (formerly  Morton-Thiokol)  in  Brigham 
City,  Utah,  manufactures  the  Reusable  Solid  Rocket  Motor  seg-
ments that are the propellant sections of the Solid Rocket Boosters. 
The Space Shuttle Projects Office at Marshall manages the Reus-
able Solid Rocket Motor contract.

Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Michoud Operations
The  External  Tank  was  developed  and  manufactured  by  Martin 
Marietta at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility near New Or-
leans, Louisiana. Martin Marietta later merged with Lockheed to 
create Lockheed Martin. The External Tank is the only disposable 
part of the Space Shuttle system, so new ones are always under 
construction. The Space Shuttle Projects Office at Marshall man-
ages the External Tank contract.
 
Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control
The  Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  (RCC)  panels  used  on  the  nose 
and wing leading edges of the Orbiter were manufactured by Ling-
Temco-Vought in Grand Prairie, Texas. Lockheed Martin acquired 
LTV through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The Space Shuttle 
Program office at Johnson manages the RCC support contract.

The Accident

ing a space vehicle will ever be as routine an undertaking as 
commercial air travel – certainly not in the lifetime of any-
body who reads this. The scientists and engineers continu-
ally work on better ways, but if we want to continue going 
into outer space, we must continue to accept the risks.

Part One of the report of the Columbia Accident Investiga-
tion Board is organized into four chapters. In order to set 
the background for further discussion, Chapter 1 relates the 
history of the Space Shuttle Program before the Challenger 
accident. The events leading to the original approval of the 
Space Shuttle Program are recounted, as well as an exami-
nation of some of the promises made in order to gain that 
approval. In retrospect, many of these promises could never 
have been achieved. Chapter 2 documents the final flight of 
Columbia. As a straightforward record of the event, it con-
tains  no  findings  or  recommendations.  Chapter  3  reviews 
five analytical paths – aerodynamic, thermodynamic, sensor 
data timeline, debris reconstruction, and imaging evidence 
– to show that all five independently arrive at the same con-
clusion. Chapter 4 describes the investigation into other pos-
sible physical factors that might have contributed to the ac-
cident, but were subsequently dismissed as possible causes.

“Building rockets is hard.” Part of the problem is that space 
travel is in its infancy. Although humans have been launch-
ing orbital vehicles for almost 50 years now – about half the 
amount of time we have been flying airplanes – contrast the 
numbers.  Since  Sputnik,  humans  have  launched  just  over 
4,500 rockets towards orbit (not counting suborbital flights 
and  small  sounding  rockets).  During  the  first  50  years  of 
aviation, there were over one million aircraft built. Almost 
all of the rockets were used only once; most of the airplanes 
were used more often.

There  is  also  the  issue  of  performance. Airplanes  slowly 
built their performance from the tens of miles per hour the 
Wright Brothers initially managed to the 4,520 mph that Ma-
jor William J. Knight flew in the X-15A-2 research airplane 
during  1967. Aircraft  designers  and  pilots  would  slightly 
push the envelope, stop and get comfortable with where they 
were, then push on. Orbital rockets, by contrast, must have 
all of their performance on the first (and often, only) flight. 
Physics dictates this – to reach orbit, without falling back to 
Earth, you have to exceed about 17,500 mph. If you cannot 
vary performance, then the only thing left to change is the 
amount of payload – the rocket designers began with small 
payloads and worked their way up.

Rockets, by their very nature, are complex and unforgiving 
vehicles. They must be as light as possible, yet attain out-
standing performance to get to orbit. Mankind is, however, 
getting better at building them. In the early days as often 
as not the vehicle exploded on or near the launch pad; that 
seldom happens any longer. It was not that different from 
early airplanes, which tended to crash about as often as they 
flew. Aircraft seldom crash these days, but rockets still fail 
between  two-and-five  percent  of  the  time.  This  is  true  of 
just about any launch vehicle – Atlas, Delta, Soyuz, Shuttle 
– regardless of what nation builds it or what basic configura-
tion is used; they all fail about the same amount of the time. 
Building  and  launching  rockets  is  still  a  very  dangerous 
business, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable fu-
ture while we gain experience at it. It is unlikely that launch-

CHAPTER 1

The Evolution of the
Space Shuttle Program

More than two decades after its first flight, the Space Shuttle 
remains the only reusable spacecraft in the world capable 
of simultaneously putting multiple-person crews and heavy 
cargo  into  orbit,  of  deploying,  servicing,  and  retrieving 
satellites, and of returning the products of on-orbit research 
to Earth. These capabilities are an important asset for the 
United States and its international partners in space. Current 
plans call for the Space Shuttle to play a central role in the 
U.S. human space flight program for years to come. 

The  Space  Shuttle  Programʼs  remarkable  successes,  how-
ever, come with high costs and tremendous risks. The Feb-
ruary 1 disintegration of Columbia during re-entry, 17 years 
after Challenger was destroyed on ascent, is the most recent 
reminder that sending people into orbit and returning them 
safely to Earth remains a difficult and perilous endeavor. 

It is the view of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board 
that the Columbia accident is not a random event, but rather 
a product of the Space Shuttle Programʼs history and current 
management  processes.  Fully  understanding  how  it  hap-
pened requires an exploration of that history and manage-
ment. This chapter charts how the Shuttle emerged from a 
series of political compromises that produced unreasonable 
expectations – even myths – about its performance, how the 
Challenger accident shattered those myths several years af-
ter NASA began acting upon them as fact, and how, in retro-
spect, the Shuttleʼs technically ambitious design resulted in 
an inherently vulnerable vehicle, the safe operation of which 
exceeded NASAʼs organizational capabilities as they existed 
at the time of the Columbia accident. The Boardʼs investiga-
tion of what caused the Columbia accident thus begins in the 
fields of East Texas but reaches more than 30 years into the 
past, to a series of economically and politically driven deci-
sions that cast the Shuttle program in a role that its nascent 
technology could not support. To understand the cause of the 
Columbia accident is to understand how a program promis-
ing reliability and cost efficiency resulted instead in a devel-
opmental vehicle that never achieved the fully operational 
status NASA and the nation accorded it.

1.1  GENESIS OF THE 
 

SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM 

The origins of the Space Shuttle Program date to discussions 
on  what  should  follow  Project Apollo,  the  dramatic  U.S. 
missions to the moon.1 NASA centered its post-Apollo plans 
on developing increasingly larger outposts in Earth orbit that 
would be launched atop Apolloʼs immense Saturn V booster. 
The space agency hoped to construct a 12-person space sta-
tion  by  1975;  subsequent  stations  would  support  50,  then 
100 people. Other stations would be placed in orbit around 
the moon and then be constructed on the lunar surface. In 
parallel, NASA would develop the capability for the manned 
exploration of Mars. The concept of a vehicle – or Space 
Shuttle – to take crews and supplies to and from low-Earth 
orbit arose as part of this grand vision (see Figure 1.1-1). To 
keep the costs of these trips to a minimum, NASA intended 
to develop a fully reusable vehicle.2

Figure  1.1-1.  Early  concepts  for  the  Space  Shuttle  envisioned  a 
reusable two-stage vehicle with the reliability and versatility of a 
commercial airliner.

NASAʼs vision of a constellation of space stations and jour-
neying to Mars had little connection with political realities 
of  the  time.  In  his  final  year  in  office,  President  Lyndon 
Johnson gave highest priority to his Great Society programs 
and to dealing with the costs and domestic turmoil associated 
with the Vietnam war. Johnsonʼs successor, President Rich-
ard Nixon, also had no appetite for another large, expensive, 
Apollo-like space commitment. Nixon rejected NASAʼs am-
bitions with little hesitation and directed that the agencyʼs bud-
get be cut as much as was politically feasible. With NASAʼs 
space station plans deferred and further production of the 
Saturn V launch vehicle cancelled, the Space Shuttle was 
the only manned space flight program that the space agency 
could hope to undertake. But without space stations to ser-
vice, NASA needed a new rationale for the Shuttle. That ra-
tionale emerged from an intense three-year process of tech-
nical studies and political and budgetary negotiations that 
attempted to reconcile the conflicting interests of NASA, the 
Department of Defense, and the White House.3 
1.2  MERGING CONFLICTING INTERESTS 

During 1970, NASAʼs leaders hoped to secure White House 
approval for developing a fully reusable vehicle to provide 
routine and low cost manned access to space. However, the 
staff of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
charged by Nixon with reducing NASAʼs budget, was skep-
tical of the value of manned space flight, especially given 
its high costs. To overcome these objections, NASA turned 
to justifying the Space Shuttle on economic grounds. If the 
same vehicle, NASA argued, launched all government and 
private  sector  payloads  and  if  that  vehicle  were  reusable, 
then the total costs of launching and maintaining satellites 
could be dramatically reduced. Such an economic argument, 
however,  hinged  on  the  willingness  of  the  Department  of 
Defense to use the Shuttle to place national security pay-
loads in orbit. When combined, commercial, scientific, and 
national security payloads would require 50 Space Shuttle 
missions per year. This was enough to justify – at least on 
paper – investing in the Shuttle.

Meeting the militaryʼs perceived needs while also keeping 
the  cost  of  missions  low  posed  tremendous  technological 
hurdles. The Department of Defense wanted the Shuttle to 
carry  a  40,000-pound  payload  in  a  60-foot-long  payload 
bay  and,  on  some  missions,  launch  and  return  to  a  West 
Coast launch site after a single polar orbit. Since the Earthʼs 
surface – including the runway on which the Shuttle was to 
land – would rotate during that orbit, the Shuttle would need 
to  maneuver  1,100  miles  to  the  east  during  re-entry. This 
“cross-range” requirement meant the Orbiter required large 
delta-shaped  wings  and  a  more  robust  thermal  protection 
system to shield it from the heat of re-entry. 

Developing  a  vehicle  that  could  conduct  a  wide  variety  of 
missions, and do so cost-effectively, demanded a revolution in 
space technology. The Space Shuttle would be the first reus-
able spacecraft, the first to have wings, and the first with a reus-
able thermal protection system. Further, the Shuttle would be 
the first to fly with reusable, high-pressure hydrogen/oxygen 
engines, and the first winged vehicle to transition from orbital 
speed to a hypersonic glide during re-entry. 

Even as the design grew in technical complexity, the Office of 
Management and Budget forced NASA to keep – or at least 
promise to keep – the Shuttleʼs development and operating 
costs low. In May 1971, NASA was told that it could count on 
a maximum of $5 billion spread over five years for any new 
development program. This budget ceiling forced NASA to 
give up its hope of building a fully reusable two-stage vehicle 
and kicked off an intense six-month search for an alternate 
design.  In  the  course  of  selling  the  Space  Shuttle  Program 
within  these  budget  limitations,  and  therefore  guaranteeing 
itself a viable post-Apollo future, NASA made bold claims 
about the expected savings to be derived from revolutionary 
technologies not yet developed. At the start of 1972, NASA 
leaders told the White House that for $5.15 billion they could 
develop  a  Space  Shuttle  that  would  meet  all  performance 
requirements,  have  a  lifetime  of  100  missions  per  vehicle, 
and cost $7.7 million per flight.4 All the while, many people, 
particularly those at the White House Office of Management 
and Budget, knew NASAʼs in-house and external economic 
studies were overly optimistic.5 

Those in favor of the Shuttle program eventually won the 
day. On January 5, 1972, President Nixon announced that 
the Shuttle would be “designed to help transform the space 
frontier of the 1970s into familiar territory, easily accessible 
for human endeavor in the 1980s and 90s. This system will 
center on a space vehicle that can shuttle repeatedly from 
Earth to orbit and back. It will revolutionize transportation 
into near space, by routinizing it. [emphasis added]”6 Some-
what ironically, the President based his decision on grounds 
very different from those vigorously debated by NASA and 
the  White  House  budget  and  science  offices.  Rather  than 
focusing on the intricacies of cost/benefit projections, Nixon 
was swayed by the political benefits of increasing employ-
ment in key states by initiating a major new aerospace pro-
gram in the 1972 election year, and by a geopolitical calcula-
tion articulated most clearly by NASA Administrator James 
Fletcher. One month before the decision, Fletcher wrote a 
memo to the White House stating, “For the U.S. not to be 
in space, while others do have men in space, is unthinkable, 
and a position which America cannot accept.”7 

The cost projections Nixon had ignored were not forgotten 
by his budget aides, or by Congress. A $5.5 billion ceiling 
imposed by the Office of Management and Budget led NASA 
to make a number of tradeoffs that achieved savings in the 
short term but produced a vehicle that had higher operational 
costs and greater risks than promised. One example was the 
question of whether the “strap-on” boosters would use liquid 
or solid propellants. Even though they had higher projected 
operational costs, solid-rocket boosters were chosen largely 
because  they  were  less  expensive  to  develop,  making  the 
Shuttle the first piloted spacecraft to use solid boosters. And 
since NASA believed that the Space Shuttle would be far 
safer than any other spacecraft, the agency accepted a design 
with no crew escape system (see Chapter 10.)

The  commitments  NASA  made  during  the  policy  process 
drove a design aimed at satisfying conflicting requirements: 
large  payloads  and  cross-range  capability,  but  also  low 
development costs and the even lower operating costs of a 
“routine” system. Over the past 22 years, the resulting ve-

hicle has proved difficult and costly to operate, riskier than 
expected, and, on two occasions, deadly.

It is the Boardʼs view that, in retrospect, the increased com-
plexity of a Shuttle designed to be all things to all people 
created inherently greater risks than if more realistic tech-
nical goals had been set at the start. Designing a reusable 
spacecraft that is also cost-effective is a daunting engineer-
ing challenge; doing so on a tightly constrained budget is 
even  more  difficult.  Nevertheless,  the  remarkable  system 
we have today is a reflection of the tremendous engineering 
expertise and dedication of the workforce that designed and 
built the Space Shuttle within the constraints it was given.

In the end, the greatest compromise NASA made was not so 
much with any particular element of the technical design, 
but  rather  with  the  premise  of  the  vehicle  itself.  NASA 
promised it could develop a Shuttle that would be launched 
almost on demand and would fly many missions each year. 
Throughout the history of the program, a gap has persisted 
between the rhetoric NASA has used to market the Space 
Shuttle and operational reality, leading to an enduring image 
of the Shuttle as capable of safely and routinely carrying out 
missions with little risk. 
1.3  SHUTTLE DEVELOPMENT, TESTING,
 

AND QUALIFICATION 

The Space Shuttle was subjected to a variety of tests before 
its first flight. However, NASA conducted these tests some-
what  differently  than  it  had  for  previous  spacecraft.8  The 
Space Shuttle Program philosophy was to ground-test key 
hardware elements such as the main engines, Solid Rocket 
Boosters, External Tank, and Orbiter separately and to use 
analytical models, not flight testing, to certify the integrated 
Space  Shuttle  system.  During  the Approach  and  Landing 
Tests (see Figure 1.3-1), crews verified that the Orbiter could 
successfully fly at low speeds and land safely; however, the 
Space  Shuttle  was  not  flown  on  an  unmanned  orbital  test 
flight prior to its first mission – a significant change in phi-
losophy compared to that of earlier American spacecraft.

Figure 1.3-1. The first Orbiter was Enterprise, shown here being 
released from the Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft during the 
Approach and Landing Tests at Edwards Air Force Base.

The  significant  advances  in  technology  that  the  Shuttleʼs 
design  depended  on  led  its  development  to  run  behind 
schedule. The date for the first Space Shuttle launch slipped 
from March 1978 to 1979, then to 1980, and finally to the 
spring of 1981. One historian has attributed one year of this 
delay “to budget cuts, a second year to problems with the 
main engines, and a third year to problems with the thermal 
protection tiles.”9 Because of these difficulties, in 1979 the 
program underwent an exhaustive White House review. The 
program  was  thought  to  be  a  billion  dollars  over  budget, 
and President Jimmy Carter wanted to make sure that it was 
worth continuing. A key factor in the White Houseʼs final 
assessment was that the Shuttle was needed to launch the 
intelligence satellites required for verification of the SALT 
II arms control treaty, a top Carter Administration priority. 
The review reaffirmed the need for the Space Shuttle, and 
with continued White House and Congressional support, the 
path was clear for its transition from development to flight. 
NASA ultimately completed Shuttle development for only 
15  percent  more  than  its  projected  cost,  a  comparatively 
small cost overrun for so complex a program.10

The Orbiter that was destined to be the first to fly into space 
was Columbia. In early 1979, NASA was beginning to feel 
the pressure of being behind schedule. Despite the fact that 
only 24,000 of the 30,000 Thermal Protection System tiles 
had been installed, NASA decided to fly Columbia from the 
manufacturing plant in Palmdale, California, to the Kennedy 
Space Center in March 1979. The rest of the tiles would be 
installed  in  Florida,  thus  allowing  NASA  to  maintain  the 
appearance of Columbiaʼs scheduled launch date. Problems 
with the main engines and the tiles were to leave Columbia 
grounded for two more years.
1.4  THE SHUTTLE BECOMES “OPERATIONAL”

On the first Space Shuttle mission, STS-1,11 Columbia car-
ried John W. Young and Robert L. Crippen to orbit on April 
12,  1981,  and  returned  them  safely  two  days  later  to  Ed-
wards Air Force Base in California (see Figure 1.4-1). After 
three years of policy debate and nine years of development, 
the Shuttle returned U.S. astronauts to space for the first time 
since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flew in July 1975. Post-
flight inspection showed that Columbia suffered slight dam-
age from excess Solid Rocket Booster ignition pressure and 
lost 16 tiles, with 148 others sustaining some damage. Over 
the  following  15  months,  Columbia  was  launched  three 
more times. At the end of its fourth mission, on July 4, 1982, 
Columbia landed at Edwards where President Ronald Rea-
gan declared to a nation celebrating Independence Day that 
“beginning with the next flight, the Columbia and her sister 
ships will be fully operational, ready to provide economi-
cal  and  routine  access  to  space  for  scientific  exploration, 
commercial ventures, and for tasks related to the national 
security” [emphasis added].12 

There were two reasons for declaring the Space Shuttle “op-
erational” so early in its flight program. One was NASAʼs 
hope  for  quick  Presidential  approval  of  its  next  manned 
space  flight  program,  a  space  station,  which  would  not 
move forward while the Shuttle was still considered devel-
opmental. The second reason was that the nation was sud-

Between 1982 and early 1986, the Shuttle demonstrated its 
capabilities  for  space  operations,  retrieving  two  commu-
nications satellites that had suffered upper-stage misfires 
after  launch,  repairing  another  communications  satellite 
on-orbit,  and  flying  science  missions  with  the  pressur-
ized European-built Spacelab module in its payload bay. 
The Shuttle took into space not only U.S. astronauts, but 
also citizens of Germany, Mexico, Canada, Saudi Arabia, 
France,  the  Netherlands,  two  payload  specialists  from 
commercial enterprises, and two U.S. legislators, Senator 
Jake Garn and Representative Bill Nelson. In 1985, when 
four Orbiters were in operation, the vehicles flew nine mis-
sions, the most launched in a single calendar year. By the 
end of 1985, the Shuttle had launched 24 communications 
satellites (see Figure 1.4-2) and had a backlog of 44 orders 
for future commercial launches. 

On the surface, the program seemed to be progressing well. 
But those close to it realized that there were numerous prob-
lems. The system was proving difficult to operate, with more 
maintenance required between flights than had been expect-
ed. Rather than needing the 10 working days projected in 
1975 to process a returned Orbiter for its next flight, by the 
end of 1985 an average of 67 days elapsed before the Shuttle 
was ready for launch.15 

Though assigned an operational role by NASA, during this 
period the Shuttle was in reality still in its early flight-test 
stage. As with any other first-generation technology, opera-
tors were learning more about its strengths and weaknesses 
from each flight, and making what changes they could, while 
still attempting to ramp up to the ambitious flight schedule 
NASA set forth years earlier. Already, the goal of launching 
50 flights a year had given way to a goal of 24 flights per year 
by 1989. The per-mission cost was more than $140 million, a 
figure that when adjusted for inflation was seven times great-
er than what NASA projected over a decade earlier.16 More 
troubling, the pressure of maintaining the flight schedule cre-
ated  a  management  atmosphere  that  increasingly  accepted 
less-than-specification performance of various components 
and  systems,  on  the  grounds  that  such  deviations  had  not 
interfered with the success of previous flights.17
1.5  THE CHALLENGER ACCIDENT 

The  illusion  that  the  Space  Shuttle  was  an  operational 
system, safe enough to carry legislators and a high-school 
teacher into orbit, was abruptly and tragically shattered on 
the morning of January 28, 1986, when Challenger was de-
stroyed 73 seconds after launch during the 25th mission (see 
Figure 1.5-1). The seven-member crew perished.

To investigate, President Reagan appointed the 13-member 
Presidential  Commission  on  the  Space  Shuttle  Challenger 
Accident, which soon became known as the Rogers Com-
mission, after its chairman, former Secretary of State Wil-
liam P. Rogers.18 Early in its investigation, the Commission 
identified  the  mechanical  cause  of  the  accident  to  be  the 
failure of the joint of one of the Solid Rocket Boosters. The 
Commission found that the design was not well understood 
by  the  engineers  that  operated  it  and  that  it  had  not  been 
adequately tested.

7 a.m., carried astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen into an 
Earth orbital mission that lasted 54 hours. 

denly facing a foreign challenger in launching commercial 
satellites. The European Space Agency decided in 1973 to 
develop Ariane, an expendable launch vehicle. Ariane first 
flew in December 1979 and by 1982 was actively competing 
with the Space Shuttle for commercial launch contracts. At 
this point, NASA still hoped that revenue from commercial 
launches would offset some or all of the Shuttleʼs operating 
costs.  In  an  effort  to  attract  commercial  launch  contracts, 
NASA heavily subsidized commercial launches by offering 
services for $42 million per launch, when actual costs were 
more than triple that figure.13 A 1983 NASA brochure titled 
We Deliver touted the Shuttle as “the most reliable, flexible, 
and cost-effective launch system in the world.”14

In  the  seventeen  years  between  the  Challenger  and  Co-
lumbia  accidents,  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  achieved 
significant successes and also underwent organizational and 
managerial changes. The program had successfully launched 
several important research satellites and was providing most 
of the “heavy lifting” of components necessary to build the 
International  Space  Station  (see  Figure  1.5-2).  But  as  the 
Board subsequently learned, things were not necessarily as 
they  appeared.  (The  post-Challenger  history  of  the  Space 
Shuttle Program is the topic of Chapter 5.) 

Figure 1.5-1. the Space Shuttle Challenger was lost during ascent 
on January 28, 1986, when an O-ring and seal in the left Solid 
Rocket Booster failed.

When the Rogers Commission discovered that, on the eve of 
the launch, NASA and a contractor had vigorously debated 
the wisdom of operating the Shuttle in the cold temperatures 
predicted  for  the  next  day,  and  that  more  senior  NASA 
managers  were  unaware  of  this  debate,  the  Commission 
shifted  the  focus  of  its  investigation  to  “NASA  manage-
ment practices, Center-Headquarters relationships, and the 
chain of command for launch commit decisions.”19 As the 
investigation  continued,  it  revealed  a  NASA  culture  that 
had gradually begun to accept escalating risk, and a NASA 
safety program that was largely silent and ineffective.

The  Rogers  Commission  report,  issued  on  June  6,  1986, 
recommended  a  redesign  and  recertification  of  the  Solid 
Rocket  Motor  joint  and  seal  and  urged  that  an  indepen-
dent body oversee its qualification and testing. The report 
concluded that the drive to declare the Shuttle operational 
had put enormous pressures on the system and stretched its 
resources to the limit. Faulting NASA safety practices, the 
Commission also called for the creation of an independent 
NASA Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, 
reporting  directly  to  the  NASA Administrator,  as  well  as 
structural changes in program management.20 (The Rogers 
Commission findings and recommendations are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 5.) It would take NASA 32 months 
before the next Space Shuttle mission was launched. Dur-
ing this time, NASA initiated a series of longer-term vehicle 
upgrades, began the construction of the Orbiter Endeavour 
to  replace  Challenger,  made  significant  organizational 
changes, and revised the Shuttle manifest to reflect a more 
realistic flight rate.

The Challenger accident also prompted policy changes. On 
August 15, 1986, President Reagan announced that the Shut-
tle would no longer launch commercial satellites. As a result 
of the accident, the Department of Defense made a decision 
to launch all future military payloads on expendable launch 
vehicles, except the few remaining satellites that required 
the Shuttleʼs unique capabilities.

1.6  CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

The Orbiter that carried the STS-107 crew to orbit 22 years 
after its first flight reflects the history of the Space Shuttle 
Program. When Columbia lifted off from Launch Complex 
39-A at Kennedy Space Center on January 16, 2003, it su-
perficially resembled the Orbiter that had first flown in 1981, 
and indeed many elements of its airframe dated back to its 
first flight. More than 44 percent of its tiles, and 41 of the 
44  wing  leading  edge  Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  (RCC) 
panels were original equipment. But there were also many 
new systems in Columbia, from a modern “glass” cockpit to 
second-generation main engines.

Although an engineering marvel that enables a wide-variety 
of on-orbit operations, including the assembly of the Inter-
national Space Station, the Shuttle has few of the mission 
capabilities  that  NASA  originally  promised.  It  cannot  be 
launched on demand, does not recoup its costs, no longer 
carries national security payloads, and is not cost-effective 
enough, nor allowed by law, to carry commercial satellites. 
Despite efforts to improve its safety, the Shuttle remains a 
complex and risky system that remains central to U.S. ambi-
tions in space. Columbiaʼs failure to return home is a harsh 
reminder that the Space Shuttle is a developmental vehicle 
that operates not in routine flight but in the realm of danger-
ous exploration.

program.  NASA  actually  spent  $9.9  billion  in  real  year  dollars  to 
take  the  Shuttle  through  design,  development  and  initial  testing.  This 
sum, when converted to fixed year 1971 dollars using the aerospace 
price  deflator,  equals  $5.9  billion,  or  a  15  percent  cost  overrun  on 
the  original  estimate  for  phase  one.  Compared  to  other  complex

CHAPTER 2

Columbiaʼs Final Flight

Space Shuttle missions are not necessarily launched in the 
same  order  they  are  planned  (or  “manifested,”  as  NASA 
calls  the  process). A  variety  of  scheduling,  funding,  tech-
nical, and – occasionally – political reasons can cause the 
shuffling  of  missions  over  the  course  of  the  two  to  three 
years it takes to plan and launch a flight. This explains why 
the 113th mission of the Space Shuttle Program was called 
STS-107. It would be the 28th flight of Columbia.

While the STS-107 mission will likely be remembered most 
for  the  way  it  ended,  there  was  a  great  deal  more  to  the 
dedicated  science  mission  than  its  tragic  conclusion.  The 
planned microgravity research spanned life sciences, physi-
cal sciences, space and earth sciences, and education. More 
than  70  scientists  were  involved  in  the  research  that  was 
conducted by Columbiaʼs seven-member crew over 16 days. 
This chapter outlines the history of STS-107 from its mis-
sion objectives and their rationale through the accident and 
its  initial  aftermath. The  analysis  of  the  accidentʼs  causes 
follows in Chapter 3 and subsequent chapters.
2.1  MISSION OBJECTIVES AND THEIR RATIONALES

Throughout the 1990s, NASA flew a number of dedicated 
science missions, usually aboard Columbia because it was 
equipped for extended-duration missions and was not being 
used for Shuttle-Mir docking missions or the assembly of 
the International Space Station. On many of these missions, 
Columbia  carried  pressurized  Spacelab  or  SPACEHAB 
modules that extended the habitable experiment space avail-
able  and  were  intended  as  facilities  for  life  sciences  and 
microgravity research. 

In June 1997, the Flight Assignment Working Group at John-
son Space Center in Houston designated STS-107, tentatively 
scheduled for launch in the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2000, a 
“research module” flight. In July 1997, several committees of 
the National Academy of Scienceʼs Space Studies Board sent 
a letter to NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin recommend-
ing that NASA dedicate several future Shuttle missions to 
microgravity and life sciences. The purpose would be to train 
scientists to take full advantage of the International Space 
Stationʼs  research  capabilities  once  it  became  operational, 
and to reduce the gap between the last planned Shuttle science 

mission and the start of science research aboard the Space 
Station.1 In March 1998, Goldin announced that STS-107, 
tentatively scheduled for launch in May 2000, would be a 
multi-disciplinary science mission modeled after STS-90, the 
Neurolab mission scheduled later in 1998.2 In October 1998, 
the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development 
and  Independent Agencies Appropriations  Conference  Re-
port expressed Congressʼ concern about the lack of Shuttle-
based science missions in Fiscal Year 1999, and added $15 
million to NASAʼs budget for STS-107. The following year 
the Conference Report reserved $40 million for a second sci-
ence mission. NASA cancelled the second science mission in 
October 2002 and used the money for STS-107. 

In  addition  to  a  variety  of  U.S.  experiments  assigned  to 
STS-107, a joint U.S./Israeli space experiment – the Medi-
terranean-Israeli Dust Experiment, or MEIDEX – was added 
to  STS-107  to  be  accompanied  by  an  Israeli  astronaut  as 
part of an international cooperative effort aboard the Shuttle 
similar to those NASA had begun in the early 1980s. Triana, 
a deployable Earth-observing satellite, was also added to the 
mission  to  save  NASA  from  having  to  buy  a  commercial 
launch to place the satellite in orbit. Political disagreements 
between Congress and the White House delayed Triana, and 
the satellite was replaced by the Fast Reaction Experiments 
Enabling Science, Technology, Applications, and Research 
(FREESTAR)  payload,  which  was  mounted  behind  the 
SPACEHAB Research Double Module.3

Schedule Slippage

STS-107  was  finally  scheduled  for  launch  on  January  11, 
2001. After 13 delays over two years, due mainly to other 
missions taking priority, Columbia was launched on January 
16, 2003 (see Figure 2.1-1). Delays may take several forms. 
When any delay is mentioned, most people think of a Space 
Shuttle sitting on the launch pad waiting for launch. But most 
delays actually occur long before the Shuttle is configured for 
a mission. This was the case for STS-107 – of the 13 delays, 
only  a  few  occurred  after  the  Orbiter  was  configured  for 
flight; most happened earlier in the planning process. Three 
specific events caused delays for STS-107:

•  Removal of Triana: This Earth-observing satellite was 

replaced with the FREESTAR payload.

•  Orbiter Maintenance Down Period: Columbiaʼs depot-
level maintenance took six months longer than original-
ly planned, primarily to correct problems encountered 
with Kapton wiring (see Chapter 4). This resulted in the 
STS-109 Hubble Space Telescope service mission be-

COLUMBIA
Columbia  was  named  after  a  Boston-based  sloop  com-
manded by Captain Robert Gray, who noted while sailing to 
the Pacific Northwest a flow of muddy water fanning from 
the shore, and decided to explore what he deemed the “Great 
River of the West.” On May 11, 1792, Gray and his crew 
maneuvered the Columbia past the treacherous sand bar and 
named the river after his ship. After a week or so of trading 
with the local tribes, Gray left without investigating where 
the river led. Instead, Gray led the Columbia and its crew on 
the first U.S. circumnavigation of the globe, carrying otter 
skins to Canton, China, before returning to Boston in 1793. 

In addition to Columbia (OV-102), which first flew in 1981, 
Challenger (OV-099) first flew in 1983, Discovery (OV-103)
in 1984, and Atlantis (OV-104) in 1985. Endeavour (OV-105),
which replaced Challenger, first flew in 1992. At the time 
of  the  launch  of  STS-107,  Columbia  was  unique  since  it 
was the last remaining Orbiter to have an internal airlock 
on  the  mid-deck.  (All  the  Orbiters  originally  had  internal 
airlocks, but all excepting Columbia were modified to pro-
vide an external docking mechanism for flights to Mir and 
the  International  Space  Station.)  Because  the  airlock  was 
not located in the payload bay, Columbia could carry longer 
payloads such as the Chandra space telescope, which used 
the full length of the payload bay. The internal airlock made 
the mid-deck more cramped than those of other Orbiters, but 
this was less of a problem when one of the laboratory mod-
ules was installed in the payload bay to provide additional 
habitable volume.

Columbia  had  been  manufactured  to  an  early  structural 
standard that resulted in the airframe being heavier than the 
later Orbiters. Coupled with a more-forward center of grav-
ity because of the internal airlock, Columbia could not carry 
as much payload weight into orbit as the other Orbiters. This 
made  Columbia  less  desirable  for  missions  to  the  Interna-
tional  Space  Station,  although  planning  was  nevertheless 
underway  to  modify  Columbia  for  an  International  Space 
Station flight sometime after STS-107.

ing launched before STS-107 because it was considered 
more urgent. 

•  Flowliner cracks: About one month before the planned 
July 19, 2002 launch date for STS-107, concerns about 
cracks  in  the  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine  propellant 
system  flowliners  caused  a  four-month  grounding  of 
the Orbiter fleet. (The flowliner, which is in the main 
propellant  feed  lines,  mitigates  turbulence  across  the 
flexible bellows to smooth the flow of propellant into 
the main engine low-pressure turbopump. It also pro-
tects  the  bellows  from  flow-induced  vibration.)  First 
discovered  on  Atlantis,  the  cracks  were  eventually 
discovered on each Orbiter; they were fixed by weld-
ing and polishing. The grounding delayed the exchange 
of  the  Expedition  5  International  Space  Station  crew 
with the Expedition 6 crew, which was scheduled for 
STS-113.  To  maintain  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion  assembly  sequence  while  minimizing  the  delay 
in returning the Expedition 5 crew, both STS-112 and 
STS-113 were launched before STS-107.

The Crew

The STS-107 crew selection process followed standard pro-
cedures. The Space Shuttle Program provided the Astronaut 
Office with mission requirements calling for a crew of seven. 
There were no special requirements for a rendezvous, extra-
vehicular activity (spacewalking), or use of the remote ma-
nipulator arm. The Chief of the Astronaut Office announced 
the crew in July 2000. To maximize the amount of science re-
search that could be performed, the crew formed two teams, 
Red and Blue, to support around-the-clock operations.

Crew Training

The Columbia Accident Investigation Board thoroughly re-
viewed all pre-mission training (see Figure 2.1-2) for the 
STS-107 crew, Houston Mission Controllers, and the Ken-

nedy Space Center Launch Control Team. Mission training 
for the STS-107 crew comprised 4,811 hours, with an addi-
tional 3,500 hours of payload-specific training. The Ascent/
Entry Flight Control Team began training with the STS-107 
crew on October 22, 2002, and participated in 16 integrated 
ascent or entry simulations. The Orbiter Flight Control team 
began training with the crew on April 23, 2002, participating 
in six joint integrated simulations with the crew and payload 
customers.  Seventy-seven  Flight  Control  Room  operators 
were assigned to four shifts for the STS-107 mission. All had 
prior certifications and had worked missions in the past. 

The STS-107 Launch Readiness Review was held on Decem-
ber 18, 2002, at the Kennedy Space Center. Neither NASA 
nor United Space Alliance noted any training issues for launch 
controllers.  The  Mission  Operations  Directorate  noted  no 
crew  or  flight  controller  training  issues  during  the  January 
9,  2003,  STS-107  Flight  Readiness  Review.  According  to 
documentation,  all  personnel  were  trained  and  certified,  or 
would be trained and certified before the flight. Appendix D.1 
contains a detailed STS-107 Training Report.

Orbiter Preparation

Board  investigators  reviewed  Columbiaʼs  maintenance,  or 
“flow” records, including the recovery from STS-109 and 
preparation  for  STS-107,  and  relevant  areas  in  NASAʼs 
Problem Reporting and Corrective Action database, which 
contained 16,500 Work Authorization Documents consisting 
of 600,000 pages and 3.9 million steps. This database main-
tains critical information on all maintenance and modifica-
tion work done on the Orbiters (as required by the Orbiter 
Maintenance Requirements and Specifications Document). 
It also maintains Corrective Action Reports that document 
problems discovered and resolved, the Lost/Found item da-
tabase, and the Launch Readiness Review and Flight Readi-
ness Review documentation (see Chapter 7).

The Board placed emphasis on maintenance done in areas 
of particular concern to the investigation. Specifically, re-
cords for the left main landing gear and door assembly and 
left wing leading edge were analyzed for any potential con-
tributing factors, but nothing relevant to the cause of the 
accident was discovered. A review of Thermal Protection 
System tile maintenance records revealed some “non-con-
formances” and repairs made after Columbiaʼs last flight, 
but these were eventually dismissed as not relevant to the 
investigation. Additionally, the Launch Readiness Review 
and Flight Readiness Review records relating to those sys-
tems and the Lost/Found item records were reviewed, and 
no relevance was found. During the Launch Readiness Re-
view and Flight Readiness Review processes, NASA teams 
analyzed 18 lost items and deemed them inconsequential. 
(Although this incident was not considered significant by 
the  Board,  a  further  discussion  of  foreign  object  debris 
may be found in Chapter 4.) 

Payload Preparation

The  payload  bay  configuration  for  STS-107  included  the 
SPACEHAB access tunnel, SPACEHAB Research Double 
Module (RDM), the FREESTAR payload, the Orbital Ac-

celeration Research Experiment, and an Extended Duration 
Orbiter pallet to accommodate the long flight time needed 
to  conduct  all  the  experiments.  Additional  experiments 
were stowed in the Orbiter mid-deck and on the SPACE-
HAB  roof  (see  Figures  2.1-3  and  2.1-4). The  total  liftoff 
payload weight for STS-107 was 24,536 pounds. Details on 
STS-107 payload preparations and on-orbit operations are 
in Appendix D.2.

Payload readiness reviews for STS-107 began in May 2002, 
with  no  significant  abnormalities  reported  throughout  the 
processing. The  final  Payload  Safety  Review  Panel  meet-
ing prior to the mission was held on January 8, 2003, at the 
Kennedy Space Center, where the Integrated Safety Assess-
ments conducted for the SPACEHAB and FREESTAR pay-
loads were presented for final approval. All payload physical 
stresses on the Orbiter were reported within acceptable lim-
its. The Extended Duration Orbiter pallet was loaded into the 
aft section of the payload bay in High Bay 3 of the Orbiter 
Processing  Facility  on  April  25,  2002.  The  SPACEHAB

and  FREESTAR  payloads  were  loaded  horizontally  on 
March 24, with an Integration Verification Test on June 6. 
The payload bay doors were closed on October 31 and were 
not opened prior to launch. (All late stow activities at the 
launch pad were accomplished in the vertical position using 
the normal crew entry hatch and SPACEHAB access tunnel.) 
Rollover of the Orbiter to the Vehicle Assembly Building for 
mating to the Solid Rocket Boosters and External Tank oc-
curred on November 18. Mating took place two days later, 
and rollout to Launch Complex 39-A was on December 9.

Unprecedented  security  precautions  were  in  place  at 
Kennedy  Space  Center  prior  to  and  during  the  launch  of 
STS-107  because  of  prevailing  national  security  concerns 
and the inclusion of an Israeli crew member. 

SPACEHAB was powered up at Launch minus 51 (L–51) 
hours (January 14) to prepare for the late stowing of time-
critical  experiments.  The  stowing  of  material  in  SPACE-
HAB once it was positioned vertically took place at L–46 
hours and was completed by L–31 hours. Late middeck pay-
load stowage, required for the experiments involving plants 
and insects, was performed at the launch pad. Flight crew 
equipment loading started at L–22.5 hours, while middeck 
experiment loading took place from Launch minus 19 to 16 
hours. Fourteen experiments, four of which were powered, 
were loaded, all without incident. 

2.2  FLIGHT PREPARATION

NASA  senior  management  conducts  a  complex  series  of 
reviews  and  readiness  polls  to  monitor  a  missionʼs  prog-
ress toward flight readiness and eventual launch. Each step 
requires written certification. At the final review, called the 
Flight Readiness Review, NASA and its contractors certify 
that the necessary analyses, verification activities, and data 
products  associated  with  the  endorsement  have  been  ac-
complished  and  “indicate  a  high  probability  for  mission 
success.” The review establishes the rationale for accepting 
any remaining identifiable risk; by signing the Certificate of 
Flight  Readiness,  NASA  senior  managers  agree  that  they 
have accomplished all preliminary items and that they agree 
to accept that risk. The Launch Integration Manager over-
sees the flight preparation process.

STS-107 Flight Preparation Process

The  flight  preparation  process  reviews  progress  toward 
flight readiness at various junctures and ensures the organi-
zation is ready for the next operational phase. This process 
includes  Project  Milestone  Reviews,  three  Program  Mile-
stone Reviews, and the Flight Readiness Review, where the 
Certification of Flight Readiness is endorsed.

The  Launch  Readiness  Review  is  conducted  within  one 
month of the launch to certify that Certification of Launch 
Readiness items from NSTS-08117, Appendices H and Q, 
Flight  Preparation  Process  Plan,  have  been  reviewed  and 
acted  upon.  The  STS-107  Launch  Readiness  Review  was 
held  at  Kennedy  Space  Center  on  December  18,  2002. 
The Kennedy Space Center Director of Shuttle Processing 
chaired the review and approved continued preparations for 
a January 16, 2003, launch. Onboard payload and experi-
mental status and late stowage activity were reviewed. 

A Flight Readiness Review, which is chaired by the Of-
fice of Space Flight Associate Administrator, usually occurs 
about two weeks before launch and provides senior NASA 
management with a summary of the certification and veri-
fication of the Space Shuttle vehicle, flight crew, payloads, 
and  rationales  for  accepting  residual  risk.  In  cases  where 
the  Flight  Preparation  Process  has  not  been  successfully 
completed, Certification of Flight Readiness exceptions will 
be made, and presented at the Pre-Launch Mission Manage-
ment Team Review for disposition. The final Flight Readi-
ness Review for STS-107 was held on January 9, 2003, a 
week prior to launch. Representatives of all organizations 
except  Flight  Crew,  Ferry  Readiness,  and  Department  of 
Defense Space Shuttle Support made presentations. Safety, 
Reliability & Quality Assurance summarized the work per-
formed on the Ball Strut Tie Rod Assembly crack, defective 
booster connector pin, booster separation motor propellant 
paint  chip  contamination,  and  STS-113  Main  Engine  1 
nozzle leak (see Appendix E.1 for the briefing charts). None 
of the work performed on these items affected the launch. 

Certificate of Flight Readiness: No actions were assigned 
during  the  Flight  Readiness  Review.  One  exception  was 
included in the Certificate of Flight Readiness pending the 
completion of testing on the Ball Strut Tie Rod Assembly.

Testing was to be completed on January 15. This exception 
was to be closed with final flight rationale at the STS-107 
Pre-launch Mission Management Team meeting. All princi-
pal managers and organizations indicated their readiness to 
support the mission. 

Normally,  a  Mission  Management  Team  –  consisting  of 
managers from Engineering, System Integration, the Space 
Flight Operations Contract Office, the Shuttle Safety Office, 
and the Johnson Space Center directors of flight crew opera-
tions, mission operations, and space and life sciences – con-
venes  two  days  before  launch  and  is  maintained  until  the 
Orbiter safely lands. The Mission Management Team Chair 
reports directly to the Shuttle Program Manager.

The Mission Management Team resolves outstanding prob-
lems outside the responsibility or authority of the Launch 
and  Flight  Directors.  During  pre-launch,  the  Mission 
Management  Team  is  chaired  by  the  Launch  Integration 
Manager  at  Kennedy  Space  Center,  and  during  flight  by 
the Space Shuttle Program Integration Manager at Johnson 
Space Center. The guiding document for Mission Manage-
ment operations is NSTS 07700, Volume VIII.

A Pre-launch Mission Management Team Meeting oc-
curs one or two days before launch to assess any open items 
or  changes  since  the  Flight  Readiness  Review,  provide  a 
GO/NO-GO  decision  on  continuing  the  countdown,  and 
approve  changes  to  the  Launch  Commit  Criteria.  Simul-
taneously,  the  Mission  Management Team  is  activated  to 
evaluate the countdown and address any issues remaining 
from the Flight Readiness Review. STS-107ʼs Pre-launch 
Mission Management Team meeting, chaired by the Acting 
Manager of Launch Integration, was held on January 14, 
some 48 hours prior to launch, at the Kennedy Space Cen-
ter. In addition to the standard topics, such as weather and 
range support, the Pre-Launch Mission Management Team 
was updated on the status of the Ball Strut Tie Rod Assem-
bly testing. The exception would remain open pending the 
presentation of additional test data at the Delta Pre-Launch 
Mission Management Team review the next day. 

The Delta Pre-Launch Mission Management Team Meet-
ing was also chaired by the Acting Manager of Launch Inte-
gration and met at 9:00 a.m. EST on January 15 at the Ken-
nedy Space Center. The major issues addressed concerned 
the  Ball  Strut  Tie  Rod Assembly  and  potential  strontium 
chromate contamination found during routine inspection of 
a (non-STS-107) spacesuit on January 14. The contamina-
tion concern was addressed and a toxicology analysis de-
termined there was no risk to the STS-107 crew. A poll of 
the principal managers and organizations indicated all were 
ready to support STS-107.

A  Pre-Tanking  Mission  Management  Team  Meeting 
was also chaired by the Acting Manager of Launch Integra-
tion. This meeting was held at 12:10 a.m. on January 16. 
A problem with the Solid Rocket Booster External Tank At-
tachment ring was addressed for the first time. Recent mis-
sion life capability testing of the material in the ring plates 
revealed static strength properties below minimum require-
ments. There were concerns that, assuming worst-case flight 

NASA TIMES
Like most engineering or technical operations, NASA 
generally  uses  Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC, 
formerly called Greenwich Mean Time) as the standard 
reference for activities. This is, for convenience, often 
converted to local time in either Florida or Texas – this 
report uses Eastern Standard Time (EST) unless other-
wise  noted.  In  addition  to  the  normal  24-hour  clock, 
NASA tells time via several other methods, all tied to 
specific events. The most recognizable of these is “T 
minus (T–)” time that counts down to every launch in 
hours,  minutes,  and  seconds.  NASA  also  uses  a  less 
precise “L minus” (L–) time that tags events that hap-
pens days or weeks prior to launch. Later in this report 
there are references to “Entry Interface plus (EI+)” time 
that counts, in seconds, from when an Orbiter begins re-
entry. In all cases, if the time is “minus” then the event 
being counted toward has not happened yet; if the time 
is “plus” then the event has already occurred.

environments, the ring plate would not meet the safety factor 
requirement of 1.4 – that is, able to withstand 1.4 times the 
maximum load expected in operation. Based on analysis of 
the anticipated flight environment for STS-107, the need to 
meet the safety factor requirement of 1.4 was waived (see 
Chapter  10).  No  Launch  Commit  Criteria  violations  were 
noted, and the STS-107 final countdown began. The loading 
of propellants into the External Tank was delayed by some 
70 minutes, until seven hours and 20 minutes before launch, 
due  to  an  extended  fuel  cell  calibration,  a  liquid  oxygen 
replenish valve problem, and a Launch Processing System 
reconfiguration. The countdown continued normally, and at 
T–9  minutes  the  Launch  Mission  Management Team  was 
polled for a GO/NO-GO launch decision. All members re-
ported GO, and the Acting Manager of Launch Integration 
gave the final GO launch decision.

Once the Orbiter clears the launch pad, responsibility passes 
from the Launch Director at the Kennedy Space Center to 
the Flight Director at Johnson Space Center. During flight, 
the mission is also evaluated from an engineering perspec-
tive  in  the  Mission  Evaluation  Room,  which  is  managed 
by Vehicle Engineering Office personnel. Any engineering 
analysis conducted during a mission is coordinated through 
and first presented to the Mission Evaluation Room, and is 
then presented by the Mission Evaluation Room manager to 
the Mission Management Team.
2.3  LAUNCH SEQUENCE

The STS-107 launch countdown was scheduled to be about 
24 hours longer than usual, primarily because of the extra 
time  required  to  load  cryogens  for  generating  electricity 
and  water  into  the  Extended  Duration  Orbiter  pallet,  and 
for final stowage of plants, insects, and other unique science 
payloads.  SPACEHAB  stowage  activities  were  about  90 
minutes behind schedule, but the overall launch countdown 
was  back  on  schedule  when  the  communication  system 
check was completed at L–24 hours.

At 7 hours and 20 minutes prior to the scheduled launch on 
January 16, 2003, ground crews began filling the External 
Tank with over 1,500,000 pounds of cryogenic propellants. 
At about 6:15 a.m., the Final Inspection Team began its vi-
sual and photographic check of the launch pad and vehicle. 
Frost had been noted during earlier inspections, but it had 
dissipated by 7:15 a.m., when the Ice Team completed its 
inspection.

Heavy  rain  had  fallen  on  Kennedy  Space  Center  while 
the Shuttle stack was on the pad. The launch-day weather 
was 65 degrees Fahrenheit with 68 percent relative humid-
ity, dew point 59 degrees, calm winds, scattered clouds at 
4,000 feet, and visibility of seven statute miles. The fore-
cast weather for Kennedy Space Center and the Transoce-
anic Abort Landing sites in Spain and Morocco was within 
launch criteria limits.

At about 7:30 a.m. the crew was driven from their quarters 
in  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  Industrial  Area  to  Launch 
Complex  39-A.  Commander  Rick  Husband  was  the  first 
crew  member  to  enter  Columbia,  at  the  195-foot  level  of 
the  launch  tower  at  7:53  a.m.  Mission  Specialist  Kalpana 
Chawla was the last to enter, at 8:45 a.m. The hatch was 
closed and locked at 9:17 a.m.

The countdown clock executed the planned hold at the T–20 
minute-mark  at  10:10  a.m.  The  primary  ascent  computer 
software was switched over to the launch-ready configura-
tion, communications checks were completed with all crew 
members, and all non-essential personnel were cleared from 
the launch area at 10:16 a.m. Fifteen minutes later the count-
down clock came out of the planned hold at the T–9 minutes, 
and at 10:35 a.m., the GO was given for Auxiliary Power 
Unit start. STS-107 began at 10:39 a.m. with ignition of the 
Solid Rocket Boosters (see Figure 2.3-1).

Wind Shear

Before  a  launch,  balloons  are  released  to  determine  the  di-
rection and speed of the winds up to 50,000 to 60,000 feet. 
Various Doppler sounders are also used to get a wind profile, 
which, for STS-107, was unremarkable and relatively constant 
at the lower altitudes.

Columbia  encountered  a  wind  shear  about  57  seconds 
after launch during the period of maximum dynamic pres-
sure (max-q). As the Shuttle passed through 32,000 feet, it 
experienced a rapid change in the out-of-plane wind speed 
of  minus  37.7  feet  per  second  over  a  1,200-foot  altitude 
range. Immediately after the vehicle flew through this alti-
tude range, its sideslip (beta) angle began to increase in the 
negative direction, reaching a value of minus 1.75 degrees 
at 60 seconds. 

A negative beta angle means that the wind vector was on 
the  left  side  of  the  vehicle,  pushing  the  nose  to  the  right 
and increasing the aerodynamic force on the External Tank 
bipod strut attachment. Several studies have indicated that 
the aerodynamic loads on the External Tank forward attach 
bipod, and also the interacting aerodynamic loads between 
the External Tank and the Orbiter, were larger than normal 
but within design limits.

Predicted and Actual I-Loads

On launch day, the General-Purpose Computers on the Or-
biter are updated with information based on the latest obser-
vations of weather and the physical properties of the vehicle. 
These  “I-loads”  are  initializing  data  sets  that  contain  ele-
ments specific to each mission, such as measured winds, at-
mospheric data, and Shuttle configuration. The I-loads output 
target angle of attack, angle of sideslip, and dynamic pressure

as a function of Mach number to ensure that the structural 
loads the Shuttle experiences during ascent are acceptable. 

After  the  accident,  investigators  analyzed  Columbiaʼs  as-
cent  loads  using  a  reconstruction  of  the  ascent  trajectory. 
The wing loads measurement used a flexible body structural 
loads assessment that was validated by data from the Modu-
lar Auxiliary  Data  System  recorder,  which  was  recovered 
from the accident debris. The wing loads assessment includ-
ed crosswind effects, angle of attack (alpha) effects, angle of 
sideslip (beta) effects, normal acceleration (g), and dynamic 
pressure (q) that could produce stresses and strains on the 
Orbiterʼs wings during ascent. This assessment showed that 
all  Orbiter  wing  loads  were  approximately  70  percent  of 
their design limit or less throughout the ascent, including the 
previously mentioned wind shear.
 
The wind shear at 57 seconds after launch and the Shuttle 
stackʼs  reaction  to  it  appears  to  have  initiated  a  very  low 
frequency oscillation, caused by liquid oxygen sloshing in-
side the External Tank,4 that peaked in amplitude 75 seconds 
after  launch  and  continued  through  Solid  Rocket  Booster 
separation at 127 seconds after launch. A small oscillation 
is not unusual during ascent, but on STS-107 the amplitude 
was larger than normal and lasted longer. Less severe wind 
shears at 95 and 105 seconds after launch contributed to the 
continuing oscillation. 

An analysis of the External Tank/Orbiter interface loads, 
using  simulated  wind  shear,  crosswind,  beta  effects,  and 
liquid oxygen slosh effects, showed that the loads on the 
External  Tank  forward  attachment  were  only  70  percent 
of the design certification limit. The External Tank slosh 
study  confirmed  that  the  flight  control  system  provided 
adequate stability throughout ascent.

The aerodynamic loads on the External Tank forward attach 
bipod were analyzed using a Computational Fluid Dynamics 
simulation, that yielded axial, side-force, and radial loads, 
and indicated that the external air loads were well below the 
design limit during the period of maximum dynamic pres-
sure and also when the bipod foam separated.

Nozzle Deflections

Both Solid Rocket Boosters and each of the Space Shuttle 
Main Engines have exhaust nozzles that deflect (“gimbal”) 
in response to flight control system commands. Review of 
the  STS-107  ascent  data  revealed  that  the  Solid  Rocket 
Booster and Space Shuttle Main Engine nozzle positions 
twice  exceeded  deflections  seen  on  previous  flights  by  a 
factor  of  1.24  to  1.33  and  1.06,  respectively. The  center 
and right main engine yaw deflections first exceeded those 
on previous flights during the period of maximum dynamic 
pressure, immediately following the wind shear. The de-
flections  were  the  flight  control  systemʼs  reaction  to  the 
wind shear, and the motion of the nozzles was well within 
the design margins of the flight control system.

Approximately 115 seconds after launch, as booster thrust 
diminished,  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster  and  Space  Shuttle 
Main Engine exhaust nozzle pitch and yaw deflections ex-

ceeded those seen previously by a factor of 1.4 and 1.06 to 
1.6,  respectively. These  deflections  were  caused  by  lower 
than expected Reusable Solid Rocket Motor performance, 
indicated  by  a  low  burn  rate;  a  thrust  mismatch  between 
the  left  and  right  boosters  caused  by  lower-than-normal 
thrust  on  the  right  Solid  Rocket  Booster;  a  small  built-in 
adjustment that favored the left Solid Rocket Booster pitch 
actuator; and flight control trim characteristics unique to the 
Performance Enhancements flight profile for STS-107.5

The Solid Rocket Booster burn rate is temperature-depen-
dent, and behaved as predicted for the launch day weather 
conditions. No two boosters burn exactly the same, and a 
minor  thrust  mismatch  has  been  experienced  on  almost 
every Space Shuttle mission. The booster thrust mismatch 
on STS-107 was well within the design margin of the flight 
control system. 

Debris Strike

Post-launch  photographic  analysis  showed  that  one  large 
piece  and  at  least  two  smaller  pieces  of  insulating  foam 
separated from the External Tank left bipod (–Y) ramp area 
at 81.7 seconds after launch. Later analysis showed that the 
larger  piece  struck  Columbia  on  the  underside  of  the  left 
wing,  around  Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  (RCC)  panels  5 
through 9, at 81.9 seconds after launch (see Figure 2.3-2).
Further  photographic  analysis  conducted  the  day  after 
launch revealed that the large foam piece was approximately 
21 to 27 inches long and 12 to 18 inches wide, tumbling at 
a minimum of 18 times per second, and moving at a relative 
velocity to the Shuttle Stack of 625 to 840 feet per second 
(416 to 573 miles per hour) at the time of impact.

Arrival on Orbit

Two  minutes  and  seven  seconds  after  launch,  the  Solid 
Rocket  Boosters  separated  from  the  External  Tank.  They 
made a normal splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean and were 
subsequently recovered and returned to the Kennedy Space 
Center  for  inspection  and  refurbishment.  Approximately 
eight and a half minutes after launch, the Space Shuttle Main 
Engines shut down normally, followed by the separation of 
the External Tank. At 11:20 a.m., a two-minute burn of the 
Orbital  Maneuvering  System  engines  began  to  position 
Columbia  in  its  proper  orbit,  inclined  39  degrees  to  the 
equator and approximately 175 miles above Earth. 
2.4  ON-ORBIT EVENTS 

By 11:39 a.m. EST, one hour after launch, Columbia was in 
orbit  and  crew  members  entered  the  “post-insertion  time-
line.”  The  crew  immediately  began  to  configure  onboard 
systems for their 16-day stay in space. 

Flight Day 1, Thursday, January 16

The payload bay doors were opened at 12:36 p.m. and the 
radiator was deployed for cooling. Crew members activated 
the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet (containing extra pro-
pellants for power and water production) and FREESTAR, 
and they began to set up the SPACEHAB module (see Fig-
ure 2.4-1). The crew then ran two experiments with the Ad-
vanced Respiratory Monitoring System stationary bicycle in 
SPACEHAB.

The crew also set up the Bioreactor Demonstration System, 
Space Technology and Research Students Bootes, Osteopo-
rosis  Experiment  in  Orbit,  Closed  Equilibrated  Biological 
Aquatic System, Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting Sys-
tem, and Biopack, and performed Low Power Transceiver 
communication tests.

Flight Day 2, Friday, January 17

The Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment 2 began measuring 
the ozone layer, while the Mediterranean Israeli Dust Ex-
periment (MEIDEX) was set to measure atmospheric aero-
sols over the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert. The 
Critical Viscosity of Xenon 2 experiment began studying the 
fluid properties of Xenon.

The crew activated the SPACEHAB Centralized Experiment 
Water Loop in preparation for the Combustion Module 2 and 
Vapor Compression Distillation Flight Experiment and also 
activated the Facility for Absorption and Surface Tension, 
Zeolite Crystal Growth, Astroculture, Mechanics of Granu-
lar  Materials,  Combined  Two  Phase  Loop  Experiment, 
European Research In Space and Terrestrial Osteoporosis, 
Biological Research in Canisters, centrifuge configurations, 
Enhanced Orbiter Refrigerator/Freezer Operations, and Mi-
crobial Physiological Flight Experiment.

Not known to Mission Control, the Columbia crew, or anyone 
else, between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m. on Flight Day 2, an object 
drifted away from the Orbiter. This object, which subsequent 

analysis suggests may have been related to the debris strike, 
had a departure velocity between 0.7 and 3.4 miles per hour, 
remained in a degraded orbit for approximately two and a 
half days, and re-entered the atmosphere between 8:45 and 
11:45 p.m. on January 19. This object was discovered after 
the accident when Air Force Space Command reviewed its ra-
dar tracking data. (See Chapter 3 for additional discussion.) 

Flight Day 3, Saturday, January 18

The crew conducted its first on-orbit press conference. Be-
cause of heavy cloud cover over the Middle East, MEIDEX 
objectives could not be accomplished. Crew members began 
an experiment to track metabolic changes in their calcium 
levels. The crew resolved a discrepancy in the SPACEHAB 
Video Switching Unit, provided body fluid samples for the 
Physiology and Biochemistry experiment, and activated the 
Vapor Compression Distillation Flight Experiment. 

Figure  2.4-1.  The  tunnel  linking  the  SPACEHAB  module  to  the 
Columbia crew compartment provides a view of Kalpana Chawla 
working in SPACEHAB.

Flight Day 4, Sunday, January 19

Husband, Chawla, Clark, and Ramon completed the first ex-
periments with the Combustion Module 2 in SPACEHAB, 
which  were  the  Laminar  Soot  Processes, Water  Mist  Fire 
suppression,  and  Structure  of  Flame  Balls  at  Low  Lewis 
number. The latter studied combustion at the limits of flam-
mability,  producing  the  weakest  flame  ever  to  burn:  each 
flame produced one watt of thermal power (a birthday-cake 
candle, by comparison, produces 50 watts). 

Experiments on the human bodyʼs response to microgravity 
continued, with a focus on protein manufacturing, bone and 
calcium  production,  renal  stone  formation,  and  saliva  and 
urine changes due to viruses. Brown captured the first ever 
images  of  upper-atmosphere  “sprites”  and  “elves,”  which 
are  produced  by  intense  cloud-to-ground  electromagnetic 
impulses radiated by heavy lightning discharges and are as-
sociated with storms near the Earthʼs surface.

The crew reported about a cup of water under the SPACE-

to the Water Separator Assembly and Aft Power Distribu-
tion Unit. The water was mopped up and Mission Control

roses and rice flowers. Experiments in the combustion cham-
ber continued. Although the temperature in SPACEHAB was 
maintained, Mission Control estimated that about a half-gal-
lon of water was unaccounted for, and began planning in-
flight maintenance for the Water Separator Assembly.

Flight Day 5, Monday, January 20

Mission  Control  saw  indications  of  an  electrical  short  on 
Rotary Separator 2 in SPACEHAB; the separator was pow-
ered down and isolated from the electrical bus. To reduce 
condensation  with  both  Rotary  Separators  off,  the  crew 
had to reduce the flow in one of Columbiaʼs Freon loops to 
SPACEHAB in order to keep the water temperature above 
the dew point and prevent condensation from forming in the 
Condensing Heat Exchanger. However, warmer water could 
lead to higher SPACEHAB cabin temperatures; fortunately, 
the crew was able to keep SPACEHAB temperatures accept-
able and avoid condensation in the heat exchanger. 

Flight Day 6, Tuesday, January 21 

The temperature in the SPACEHAB module reached 81 de-
grees Fahrenheit. The crew reset the temperature to accept-
able levels, and Mission Control developed a contingency 
plan to re-establish SPACEHAB humidity and temperature 
control if further degradation occurred. The Miniature Satel-
lite Threat Reporting System, which detects ground-based 
radio frequency sources, experienced minor command and 
telemetry problems.

Flight Day 7, Wednesday, January 22

Both teams took a half day off. MEIDEX tracked thunder-
storms over central Africa and captured images of four sprites 
and two elves as well as two rare images of meteoroids enter-
ing  Earthʼs  atmosphere.  Payload  experiments  continued  in 
SPACEHAB, with no further temperature complications.

Flight Day 8, Thursday, January 23

Eleven  educational  events  were  completed  using  the  low-
power transceiver to transfer data files to and from schools 
in Maryland and Massachusetts. The Mechanics of Granular 
Materials experiment completed the sixth of nine tests. Bio-
pack shut down, and attempts to recycle the power were un-
successful; ground teams began developing a repair plan. 

Mission Control e-mailed Husband and McCool that post- 
launch photo analysis showed foam from the External Tank 
had  struck  the  Orbiterʼs  left  wing  during  ascent.  Mission 
Control relayed that there was “no concern for RCC or tile 
damage” and because the phenomenon had been seen be-
fore, there was “absolutely no concern for entry.” Mission 
Control also e-mailed a short video clip of the debris strike, 
which Husband forwarded to the rest of the crew.

conference  in  the  SPACEHAB  Research  Double  Module  aboard

Flight Day 10, Saturday, January 25

Experiments  with  bone  cells,  prostate  cancer,  bacteria 
growth,  thermal  heating,  and  surface  tension  continued. 
MEIDEX captured images of plumes of dust off the coasts 
of  Nigeria,  Mauritania,  and  Mali.  Images  of  sprites  were 
captured  over  storms  in  Perth,  Australia.  Biopack  power 
could not be restored, so all subsequent Biopack sampling 
was performed at ambient temperatures. 

Flight Day 11, Sunday, January 26

Vapor  Compression  Distillation  Flight  Experiment  opera-
tions were complete; SPACEHAB temperature was allowed 
to drop to 73 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists received the first 
live  Xybion  digital  downlink  images  from  MEIDEX  and 
confirmed significant dust in the Middle East. The STARS 
experiment hatched a fish in the aquatic habitat and a silk 
moth from its cocoon.

Flight Day 9, Friday, January 24

Flight Day 12, Monday, January 27

Crew members conducted the missionʼs longest combustion 
test. Spiral moss growth experiments continued, as well as 
Astroculture experiments that harvested samples of oils from 

Combustion and granular materials experiments concluded. 
The combustion module was configured for the Water Mist 
experiment, which developed a leak. The Microbial Physiol-

ogy Flight Experiment expended its final set of samples in 
yeast and bacteria growth. The crew made a joint observa-
tion using MEIDEX and the Ozone Limb Sounding Experi-
ment. MEIDEX captured images of dust over the Atlantic 
Ocean for the first time. 

Flight Day 13, Tuesday, January 28

The crew took another half day off. The Bioreactor experi-
ment produced a bone and prostate cancer tumor tissue sam-
ple the size of a golf ball, the largest ever grown in space. 
The crew, along with ground support personnel, observed 
a moment of silence to honor the memory of the men and 
women of Apollo 1 and Challenger. MEIDEX was prepared 
to monitor smoke trails from research aircraft and bonfires 
in Brazil. Water Mist runs began after the leak was stopped. 

Flight Day 14, Wednesday, January 29

Ramon reported a giant dust storm over the Atlantic Ocean 
that provided three days of MEIDEX observations. Ground 
teams confirmed predicted weather and climate effects and 
found a huge smoke plume in a large cumulus cloud over 
the Amazon  jungle.  BIOTUBE  experiment  ground  teams 
reported growth rates and root curvatures in plant and flax 
roots  different  from  anything  seen  in  normal  gravity  on 
Earth.  The  crew  received  procedures  from  Mission  Con-
trol for vacuum cleanup and taping of the Water Separator 
Assembly  prior  to  re-entry.  Temperatures  in  two  Biopack 
culture chambers were too high for normal cell growth, so 
several Biopack experiments were terminated. 

Flight Day 15, Thursday, January 30 

Final samples and readings were taken for the Physiology 
and Biochemistry team experiments. Husband, McCool, and 
Chawla  ran  landing  simulations  on  the  computer  training 
system. Husband found no excess water in the SPACEHAB 
sub-floor, but as a precaution, he covered several holes in the 
Water Separator Assembly. 

Flight Day 16, Friday, January 31

The Water Mist Experiment concluded and the combustion 
module  was  closed.  MEIDEX  made  final  observations  of 
dust concentrations, sprites, and elves. Husband, McCool, 
and Chawla completed their second computer-based landing 
simulation. A flight control system checkout was performed 
satisfactorily using Auxiliary Power Unit 1, with a run time 
of 5 minutes, 27 seconds.

After the flight control system checkout, a Reaction Control 
System  “hot-fire”  was  performed  during  which  all  thrust-
ers were fired for at least 240 milliseconds. The Ku-band 
antenna and the radiator on the left payload bay door were 
stowed.

Flight Day 17, Saturday, February 1

All onboard experiments were concluded and stowed, and 
payload  doors  and  covers  were  closed.  Preparations  were 
completed for de-orbit, re-entry, and landing at the Kennedy 

Rick Husband works with the Biological Research in Canister ex-
periment on Columbiaʼs mid-deck.

Space  Center.  Suit  checks  confirmed  that  proper  pressure 
would be maintained during re-entry and landing. The pay-
load bay doors were closed. Husband and McCool config-
ured the onboard computers with the re-entry software, and 
placed Columbia in the proper attitude for the de-orbit burn. 
2.5  DEBRIS STRIKE ANALYSIS
 

AND REQUESTS FOR IMAGERY

As is done after every launch, within two hours of the lift-
off  the  Intercenter  Photo Working  Group  examined  video 
from tracking cameras. An initial review did not reveal any 
unusual events. The next day, when the Intercenter Photo 
Working Group personnel received much higher resolution 
film that had been processed overnight, they noticed a debris 
strike at 81.9 seconds after launch. 

A large object from the left bipod area of the External Tank 
struck the Orbiter, apparently impacting the underside of the 
left wing near RCC panels 5 through 9. The objectʼs large 
size and the apparent momentum transfer concerned Inter-
center Photo Working Group personnel, who were worried 
that Columbia had sustained damage not detectable in the 
limited  number  of  views  their  tracking  cameras  captured. 
This concern led the Intercenter Photo Working Group Chair 
to  request,  in  anticipation  of  analystsʼ  needs,  that  a  high-
resolution image of the Orbiter on-orbit be obtained by the 
Department of Defense. By the Boardʼs count, this would 
be  the  first  of  three  distinct  requests  to  image  Columbia
on-orbit. The exact chain of events and circumstances sur-
rounding the movement of each of these requests through 
Shuttle Program Management, as well as the ultimate denial 
of these requests, is a topic of Chapter 6.

After discovering the strike, the Intercenter Photo Working 
Group prepared a report with a video clip of the impact and 
sent it to the Mission Management Team, the Mission Evalu-
ation  Room,  and  engineers  at  United  Space  Alliance  and 
Boeing. In accordance with NASA guidelines, these contrac-
tor and NASA engineers began an assessment of potential 
impact damage to Columbiaʼs left wing, and soon formed a 
Debris Assessment Team to conduct a formal review.

The first formal Debris Assessment Team meeting was held 
on January 21, five days into the mission. It ended with the 
highest-ranking  NASA  engineer  on  the  team  agreeing  to 
bring the teamʼs request for imaging of the wing on-orbit, 
which would provide better information on which to base 
their  analysis,  to  the  Johnson  Space  Center  Engineering 
Management Directorate, with the expectation the request 
would go forward to Space Shuttle Program managers. De-
bris Assessment Team members subsequently learned that 
these managers declined to image Columbia. 

Without on-orbit pictures of Columbia, the Debris Assess-
ment Team was restricted to using a mathematical modeling 
tool called Crater to assess damage, although it had not been 
designed with this type of impact in mind. Team members 
concluded over the next six days that some localized heating 
damage  would  most  likely  occur  during  re-entry,  but  they 
could  not  definitively  state  that  structural  damage  would 
result. On January 24, the Debris Assessment Team made a 
presentation of these results to the Mission Evaluation Room, 
whose manager gave a verbal summary (with no data) of that 
presentation to the Mission Management Team the same day. 
The Mission Management Team declared the debris strike a 
“turnaround” issue and did not pursue a request for imagery. 

Even  after  the  Debris Assessment  Teamʼs  conclusion  had 
been reported to the Mission Management Team, engineers 
throughout  NASA  and  Mission  Control  continued  to  ex-
change e-mails and discuss possible damage. These messag-
es and discussions were generally sent only to people within 
the sendersʼ area of expertise and level of seniority.

2.6  DE-ORBIT BURN AND RE-ENTRY EVENTS

At  2:30  a.m.  EST  on  February  1,  2003,  the  Entry  Flight 
Control  Team  began  duty  in  the  Mission  Control  Center. 
The  Flight  Control  Team  was  not  working  any  issues  or 
problems  related  to  the  planned  de-orbit  and  re-entry  of 
Columbia.  In  particular,  the  team  indicated  no  concerns 
about the debris impact to the left wing during ascent, and 
treated the re-entry like any other. 

The team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist 
and re-entry checklist procedures. Weather forecasters, with 
the help of pilots in the Shuttle Training Aircraft, evaluated 
landing site weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Cen-
ter. At the time of the de-orbit decision, about 20 minutes 
before the initiation of the de-orbit burn, all weather obser-
vations and forecasts were within guidelines set by the flight 
rules, and all systems were normal. 

Shortly after 8:00 a.m., the Mission Control Center Entry 
Flight Director polled the Mission Control room for a GO/
NO-GO decision for the de-orbit burn, and at 8:10 a.m., the 
Capsule Communicator notified the crew they were GO for 
de-orbit burn. 

As the Orbiter flew upside down and tail-first over the In-
dian Ocean at an altitude of 175 statute miles, Commander 
Husband  and  Pilot  McCool  executed  the  de-orbit  burn  at 
8:15:30  a.m.  using  Columbiaʼs  two  Orbital  Maneuvering 
System engines. The de-orbit maneuver was performed on 
the 255th orbit, and the 2-minute, 38-second burn slowed 
the Orbiter from 17,500 mph to begin its re-entry into the 
atmosphere. During the de-orbit burn, the crew felt about 
10  percent  of  the  effects  of  gravity. There  were  no  prob-
lems  during  the  burn,  after  which  Husband  maneuvered 
Columbia into a right-side-up, forward-facing position, with 
the Orbiterʼs nose pitched up. 

Entry Interface, arbitrarily defined as the point at which the 
Orbiter  enters  the  discernible  atmosphere  at  400,000  feet, 
occurred at 8:44:09 a.m. (Entry Interface plus 000 seconds, 
written EI+000) over the Pacific Ocean. As Columbia de-
scended from space into the atmosphere, the heat produced 
by air molecules colliding with the Orbiter typically caused 
wing  leading-edge  temperatures  to  rise  steadily,  reaching 
an estimated 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit during the next six 
minutes.  As  superheated  air  molecules  discharged  light, 
astronauts on the flight deck saw bright flashes envelop the 
Orbiter, a normal phenomenon. 

At 8:48:39 a.m. (EI+270), a sensor on the left wing leading 
edge spar showed strains higher than those seen on previous 
Columbia re-entries. This was recorded only on the Modular 
Auxiliary Data System, and was not telemetered to ground 
controllers or displayed to the crew (see Figure 2.6-1).

At 8:49:32 a.m. (EI+323), traveling at approximately Mach 
24.5, Columbia executed a roll to the right, beginning a pre-
planned banking turn to manage lift, and therefore limit the 
Orbiterʼs rate of descent and heating. 

At  8:50:53  a.m.  (EI+404),  traveling  at  Mach  24.1  and  at 
approximately 243,000 feet, Columbia entered a 10-minute 
period of peak heating, during which the thermal stresses 
were at their maximum. By 8:52:00 a.m. (EI+471), nearly 
eight minutes after entering the atmosphere and some 300 
miles west of the California coastline, the wing leading-edge 
temperatures  usually  reached  2,650  degrees  Fahrenheit. 
Columbia crossed the California coast west of Sacramento 
at 8:53:26 a.m. (EI+557). Traveling at Mach 23 and 231,600 
feet, the Orbiterʼs wing leading edge typically reached more 
than an estimated 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Columbia streaking over the Very Large Array
radio telescope in Socorro, New Mexico.

Now  crossing  California,  the  Orbiter  appeared  to  observ-
ers on the ground as a bright spot of light moving rapidly 
across the sky. Signs of debris being shed were sighted at 
8:53:46 a.m. (EI+577), when the superheated air surround-
ing  the  Orbiter  suddenly  brightened,  causing  a  noticeable 
streak in the Orbiterʼs luminescent trail. Observers witnessed 
another four similar events during the following 23 seconds, 
and a bright flash just seconds after Columbia crossed from 
California  into  Nevada  airspace  at  8:54:25  a.m.  (EI+614), 
when the Orbiter was traveling at Mach 22.5 and 227,400 
feet. Witnesses observed another 18 similar events in the next 
four minutes as Columbia streaked over Utah, Arizona, New 
Mexico, and Texas.

In  Mission  Control,  re-entry  appeared  normal  until  8:54:24 
a.m. (EI+613), when the Maintenance, Mechanical, and Crew 
Systems (MMACS) officer informed the Flight Director that 
four hydraulic sensors in the left wing were indicating “off-
scale low,” a reading that falls below the minimum capability 
of the sensor. As the seconds passed, the Entry Team contin-
ued to discuss the four failed indicators. 

At 8:55:00 a.m. (EI+651), nearly 11 minutes after Columbia 
had re-entered the atmosphere, wing leading edge tempera-
tures normally reached nearly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At 
8:55:32 a.m. (EI+683), Columbia crossed from Nevada into 
Utah while traveling at Mach 21.8 and 223,400 ft. Twenty 
seconds later, the Orbiter crossed from Utah into Arizona.

At 8:56:30 a.m. (EI+741), Columbia initiated a roll reversal, 
turning from right to left over Arizona. Traveling at Mach 
20.9 and 219,000 feet, Columbia crossed the Arizona-New 
Mexico state line at 8:56:45 (EI+756), and passed just north 
of Albuquerque at 8:57:24 (EI+795).

Around  8:58:00  a.m.  (EI+831),  wing  leading  edge  tem-
peratures  typically  decreased  to  2,880  degrees  Fahrenheit. 
At 8:58:20 a.m. (EI+851), traveling at 209,800 feet and Mach 
19.5, Columbia crossed from New Mexico into Texas, and 
about this time shed a Thermal Protection System tile, which 
was the most westerly piece of debris that has been recovered. 

Searchers found the tile in a field in Littlefield, Texas, just 
northwest of Lubbock. At 8:59:15 a.m. (EI+906), MMACS 
informed the Flight Director that pressure readings had been 
lost on both left main landing gear tires. The Flight Director 
then told the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) to let the 
crew know that Mission Control saw the messages and was 
evaluating the indications, and added that the Flight Control 
Team did not understand the crewʼs last transmission.

At  8:59:32  a.m.  (EI+923),  a  broken  response  from  the 
mission commander was recorded: “Roger, [cut off in mid-
word] …” It was the last communication from the crew and 
the last telemetry signal received in Mission Control. Videos 
made by observers on the ground at 9:00:18 a.m. (EI+969) 
revealed that the Orbiter was disintegrating.
2.7  EVENTS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
 

THE ACCIDENT

A series of events occurred immediately after the accident 
that would set the stage for the subsequent investigation.

NASA Emergency Response

Shortly after the scheduled landing time of 9:16 a.m. EST, 
NASA declared a “Shuttle Contingency” and executed the 
Contingency  Action  Plan  that  had  been  established  after 
the  Challenger  accident. As  part  of  that  plan,  NASA Ad-
ministrator Sean OʼKeefe activated the International Space 
Station and Space Shuttle Mishap Interagency Investigation 
Board at 10:30 a.m. and named Admiral Harold W. Gehman 
Jr., U.S. Navy, retired, as its chair. 

Senior members of the NASA leadership met as part of the 
Headquarters Contingency Action Team and quickly notified 
astronaut families, the President, and members of Congress. 
President Bush telephoned Israeli Prime Minster Ariel Sha-
ron to inform him of the loss of Columbia crew member Ilan 
Ramon, Israelʼs first astronaut. Several hours later, President 
Bush addressed the nation, saying, “The Columbia is lost. 
There are no survivors.”

MISSION CONTROL CENTER COMMUNICATIONS

At 8:49 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EI+289), the Orbiterʼs flight 
control system began steering a precise course, or drag profile, 
with the initial roll command occurring about 30 seconds later. At 
8:49:38 a.m., the Mission Control Guidance and Procedures offi-
cer called the Flight Director and indicated that the “closed-loop” 
guidance system had been initiated. 

The Maintenance, Mechanical, and Crew Systems (MMACS) of-
ficer and the Flight Director (Flight) had the following exchange 
beginning at 8:54:24 a.m. (EI+613).

MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS.”
Flight:  
MMACS:   “FYI, Iʼve just lost four separate temperature

return temperatures. Two of them on system one and 
one in each of systems two and three.”
“Four hyd [hydraulic] return temps?”

Flight:  
MMACS:   “To the left outboard and left inboard elevon.”
Flight:  

“Okay, is there anything common to them? DSC 
[discrete signal conditioner] or MDM [multiplexer-
demultiplexer] or anything? I mean, youʼre telling 
me you lost them all at exactly the same time?”

MMACS:   “No, not exactly. They were within probably four or 

Flight:  

five seconds of each other.”
“Okay, where are those, where is that instrumenta-
tion located?”

MMACS:   “All four of them are located in the aft part of the 

left wing, right in front of the elevons, elevon actua-
tors. And there is no commonality.”
“No commonality.”

Flight:  

At 8:56:02 a.m. (EI+713), the conversation between the Flight 
Director and the MMACS officer continues:

Flight: 
MMACS:   “Thatʼs all three hydraulic systems. Itʼs ... two of 

“MMACS, tell me again which systems theyʼre for.”

them are to the left outboard elevon and two of them 
to the left inboard.”
“Okay, I got you.”

Flight:

The Flight Director then continues to discuss indications with other 
Mission Control Center personnel, including the Guidance, Navi-
gation, and Control officer (GNC).

Flight:  
GNC:  
Flight: 

GNC:  

“GNC – Flight.”
“Flight – GNC.”
 “Everything look good to you, control and rates and 
everything is nominal, right?”
“Controlʼs been stable through the rolls that weʼve 
done so far, flight. We have good trims. I donʼt see 
anything out of the ordinary.”
“Okay. And MMACS, Flight?”

Flight:  
MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS.”
Flight:  

“All other indications for your hydraulic system 
indications are good.”

MMACS:   “Theyʼre all good. Weʼve had good quantities all the 

way across.”
“And the other temps are normal?”

Flight: 
MMACS:   “The other temps are normal, yes sir.”
Flight: 

“And when you say you lost these, are you saying 
that they went to zero?” [Time: 8:57:59 a.m., EI+830] 
“Or, off-scale low?”

MMACS:   “All four of them are off-scale low. And they were 
all staggered. They were, like I said, within several 
seconds of each other.” 
“Okay.”

Flight: 

At  8:58:00  a.m.  (EI+831),  Columbia  crossed  the  New  Mexico-
Texas  state  line.  Within  the  minute,  a  broken  call  came  on  the 
air-to-ground voice loop from Columbiaʼs commander, “And, uh, 
Hou …” This was followed by a call from MMACS about failed tire 
pressure sensors at 8:59:15 a.m. (EI+906).

MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS.”
Flight:  
MMACS:   “We just lost tire pressure on the left outboard and left

The Flight Director then told the Capsule Communicator (CAP-
COM) to let the crew know that Mission Control saw the messages 
and that the Flight Control Team was evaluating the indications 
and did not copy their last transmission.

GNC:  

Flight:  

“If we have any reason to suspect any sort of 
controllability issue, I would keep the control cards 
handy on page 4-dash-13.”
“Copy.”

CAPCOM:  “And Columbia, Houston, we see your tire pressure 

messages and we did not copy your last call.”
“Is it instrumentation, MMACS? Gotta be ...”

Flight: 
MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS, those are also off-scale low.”

At  8:59:32  a.m.  (EI+923),  Columbia  was  approaching  Dallas, 
Texas, at 200,700 feet and Mach 18.1. At the same time, another 
broken call, the final call from Columbiaʼs commander, came on 
the air-to-ground voice loop:

Commander: “Roger, [cut off in mid-word] …” 

This call may have been about the backup flight system tire pres-
sure fault-summary messages annunciated to the crew onboard, 
and seen in the telemetry by Mission Control personnel. An ex-
tended loss of signal began at 08:59:32.136 a.m. (EI+923). This 
was the last valid data accepted by the Mission Control computer 
stream, and no further real-time data updates occurred in Mis-
sion Control. This coincided with the approximate time when the 
Flight Control Team would expect a short-duration loss of signal 
during antenna switching, as the onboard communication system 
automatically  reconfigured  from  the  west  Tracking  and  Data 
Relay System satellite to either the east satellite or to the ground 
station at Kennedy Space Center. The following exchange then 
took place on the Flight Director loop with the Instrumentation 
and Communication Office (INCO):

INCO:  
Flight:  
INCO:  

“Flight – INCO.”
“Go.”
“Just taking a few hits here. Weʼre right up on top of 
the tail. Not too bad.”

The  Flight  Director  then  resumes  discussion  with  the  MMACS 
officer at 9:00:18 a.m. (EI+969).

“MMACS – Flight.”
Flight:  
MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS.”
Flight:  

“And thereʼs no commonality between all these tire 
pressure instrumentations and the hydraulic return 
instrumentations.”

MMACS:   “No sir, thereʼs not. Weʼve also lost the nose gear 
down talkback and the right main gear down talk-
back.”
“Nose gear and right main gear down talkbacks?”

Flight:  
MMACS:   “Yes sir.”

At 9:00:18 a.m. (EI+969), the postflight video and imagery anal-
yses indicate that a catastrophic event occurred. Bright flashes 
suddenly enveloped the Orbiter, followed by a dramatic change in 
the trail of superheated air. This is considered the most likely time 
of the main breakup of Columbia. Because the loss of signal had 
occurred 46 seconds earlier, Mission Control had no insight into 
this event. Mission Control continued to work the loss-of-signal 
problem to regain communication with Columbia:

INCO:  

Flight:  

GC:  
GNC:  
Flight:  

“Flight – INCO, I didnʼt expect, uh, this bad of a hit 
on comm [communications].”
“GC [Ground Control officer] how far are we from 
UHF? Is that two-minute clock good?”
“Affirmative, Flight.”
“Flight – GNC.”
“Go.”

At  9:02:21  a.m.  (EI+1092,  or  18  minutes-plus),  the  Mission 
Control  Center  commentator  reported,  “Fourteen  minutes  to 
touchdown  for  Columbia  at  the  Kennedy  Space  Center.  Flight 
controllers are continuing to stand by to regain communications 
with the spacecraft.”

Flight:  

INCO:  

Flight:  

INCO:  
Flight:  
INCO:  

“INCO, we were rolled left last data we had and you 
were expecting a little bit of ratty comm [communi-
cations], but not this long?”
“Thatʼs correct, Flight. I expected it to be a little 
intermittent. And this is pretty solid right here.”
“No onboard system config [configuration] changes 
right before we lost data?”
“That is correct, Flight. All looked good.”
“Still on string two and everything looked good?”
“String two looking good.”

The  Ground  Control  officer  then  told  the  Flight  Director  that 
the  Orbiter  was  within  two  minutes  of  acquiring  the  Kennedy 
Space Center ground station for communications, “Two minutes 
to MILA.” The Flight Director told the CAPCOM to try another 
communications check with Columbia, including one on the UHF 
system (via MILA, the Kennedy Space Center tracking station):

CAPCOM:  “Columbia, Houston, comm [communications] 

CAPCOM:  “Columbia, Houston, UHF comm [communications] 

check.”

check.”

At 9:03:45 a.m. (EI+1176, or 19 minutes-plus), the Mission Con-
trol Center commentator reported, “CAPCOM Charlie Hobaugh 
calling Columbia on a UHF frequency as it approaches the Mer-
ritt Island (MILA) tracking station in Florida. Twelve-and-a-half 
minutes to touchdown, according to clocks in Mission Control.”

”MMACS?”

MMACS:   “Flight – MMACS.”
Flight:  
MMACS:   “On the tire pressures, we did see them go erratic for 
a little bit before they went away, so I do believe itʼs 
instrumentation.”
“Okay.”

Flight:  

The Flight Control Team still had no indications of any serious 
problems onboard the Orbiter. In Mission Control, there was no 
way to know the exact cause of the failed sensor measurements, 
and while there was concern for the extended loss of signal, the 
recourse was to continue to try to regain communications and in 
the meantime determine if the other systems, based on the last 
valid data, continued to appear as expected. The Flight Director 
told the CAPCOM to continue to try to raise Columbia via UHF:

CAPCOM:  “Columbia, Houston, UHF comm [communications] 

check.”

CAPCOM:  “Columbia, Houston, UHF comm [communications] 

GC:  
Flight:  
GC:  

check.”
“Flight – GC.”
“Go.”
“MILA not reporting any RF [radio frequency] at 
this time.”

“I could swap strings in the blind.”
“Okay, command us over.”
“In work, Flight.”

At 09:08:25 a.m. (EI+1456, or 24 minutes-plus), the Instrumen-
tation and Communications Officer reported, “Flight – INCO, 
Iʼve commanded string one in the blind,” which indicated that 
the officer had executed a command sequence to Columbia to 
force the onboard S-band communications system to the backup 
string of avionics to try to regain communication, per the Flight 
Directorʼs direction in the previous call.

point, Flight. We do not believe that was the 
Orbiter [referring to an errant blip on the large 
front screen in the Mission Control, where Orbiter 
tracking data is displayed.] Weʼre entering a 
search pattern with our C-bands at this time. We 
do not have any valid data at this time.”

By this time, 9:09:29 a.m. (EI+1520), Columbiaʼs speed would 
have dropped to Mach 2.5 for a standard approach to the Ken-
nedy Space Center.

“OK. Any other trackers that we can go to?”
“Let me start talking, Flight, to my navigator.”

At 9:12:39 a.m. (E+1710, or 28 minutes-plus), Columbia should 
have been banking on the heading alignment cone to line up on 
Runway 33. At about this time, a member of the Mission Con-
trol team received a call on his cell phone from someone who 
had  just  seen  live  television  coverage  of  Columbia  breaking 
up during re-entry. The Mission Control team member walked 
to the Flight Directorʼs console and told him the Orbiter had 
disintegrated.

Having  confirmed  the  loss  of  Columbia,  the  Entry  Flight  Di-
rector  directed the Flight Control Team to begin contingency 
procedures.

In  order  to  preserve  all  material  relating  to  STS-107  as 
evidence for the accident investigation, NASA officials im-
pounded data, software, hardware, and facilities at NASA 
and  contractor  sites  in  accordance  with  the  pre-existing 
mishap response plan. 

At the Johnson Space Center, the door to Mission Control 
was  locked  while  personnel  at  the  flight  control  consoles 
archived  all  original  mission  data. At  the  Kennedy  Space 
Center,  mission  facilities  and  related  hardware,  including 
Launch Complex 39-A, were put under guard or stored in 
secure  warehouses.  Officials  took  similar  actions  at  other 
key Shuttle facilities, including the Marshall Space Flight 
Center and the Michoud Assembly Facility.

Within minutes of the accident, the NASA Mishap Inves-
tigation Team was activated to coordinate debris recovery 
efforts with local, state, and federal agencies. The team ini-
tially operated out of Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana 
and soon after in Lufkin, Texas, and Carswell Field in Fort 
Worth, Texas.

Debris Search and Recovery

On the morning of February 1, a crackling boom that sig-
naled  the  breakup  of  Columbia  startled  residents  of  East 
Texas.  The  long,  low-pitched  rumble  heard  just  before 
8:00 a.m. Central Standard Time (CST) was generated by 
pieces  of  debris  streaking  into  the  upper  atmosphere  at 
nearly 12,000 miles per hour. Within minutes, that debris 
fell to the ground. Cattle stampeded in Eastern Nacogdo-
ches  County. A  fisherman  on  Toledo  Bend  reservoir  saw 
a piece splash down in the water, while a women driving 
near  Lufkin  almost  lost  control  of  her  car  when  debris 
smacked her windshield. As 911 dispatchers across Texas 
were flooded with calls reporting sonic booms and smoking 
debris,  emergency  personnel  soon  realized  that  residents 
were encountering the remnants of the Orbiter that NASA 
had reported missing minutes before.

The emergency response that began shortly after 8:00 a.m. 
CST Saturday morning grew into a massive effort to decon-
taminate and recover debris strewn over an area that in Texas 
alone exceeded 2,000 square miles (see Figure 2.7-1). Local 
fire and police departments called in all personnel, who be-
gan responding to debris reports that by late afternoon were 
phoned in at a rate of 18 per minute. 

Within  hours  of  the  accident,  President  Bush  declared 
East  Texas  a  federal  disaster  area,  enabling  the  dispatch 
of  emergency  response  teams  from  the  Federal  Emer-
gency Management Agency and Environmental Protection 
Agency. As the day wore on, county constables, volunteers 
on  horseback,  and  local  citizens  headed  into  pine  forests 
and bushy thickets in search of debris and crew remains, 
while National Guard units mobilized to assist local law-
enforcement guard debris sites. Researchers from Stephen 
F. Austin  University  sent  seven  teams  into  the  field  with 
Global Positioning System units to mark the exact location 
of debris. The researchers and later searchers then used this 
data to update debris distribution on detailed Geographic 
Information System maps.

Public Safety Concerns

From the start, NASA officials sought to make the public 
aware  of  the  hazards  posed  by  certain  pieces  of  debris, 
as well as the importance of turning over all debris to the 
authorities. Columbia carried highly toxic propellants that 
maneuvered  the  Orbiter  in  space  and  during  early  stages 
of  re-entry. These  propellants  and  other  gases  and  liquids 
were stored in pressurized tanks and cylinders that posed a 
danger to people who might approach Orbiter debris. The 
propellants, monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, 
as well as concentrated ammonia used in the Orbiterʼs cool-
ing systems, can severely burn the lungs and exposed skin 
when encountered in vapor form. Other materials used in the 
Orbiter, such as beryllium, are also toxic. The Orbiter also 
contains  various  pyrotechnic  devices  that  eject  or  release 
items such as the Ku-Band antenna, landing gear doors, and 
hatches  in  an  emergency.  These  pyrotechnic  devices  and 
their  triggers,  which  are  designed  to  withstand  high  heat 
and therefore may have survived re-entry, posed a danger to 
people and livestock. They had to be removed by personnel 
trained in ordnance disposal. 

In light of these and other hazards, NASA officials worked 
with local media and law enforcement to ensure that no one 
on the ground would be injured. To determine that Orbiter 
debris did not threaten air quality or drinking water, the Envi-

ronmental Protection Agency activated Emergency Response 
and Removal Service contractors, who surveyed the area. 

Land Search

The  tremendous  efforts  mounted  by  the  National  Guard, 
Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety,  and  emergency  per-
sonnel from local towns and communities were soon over-
whelmed by the expanding bounds of the debris field, the 
densest region of which ran from just south of Fort Worth, 
Texas,  to  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana.  Faced  with  a  debris  field 
several  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  any  previous  ac-
cident  site,  NASA  and  Federal  Emergency  Management 
Agency officials activated Forest Service wildland firefight-
ers to serve as the primary search teams. As NASA identi-
fied the areas to be searched, personnel and equipment were 
furnished by the Forest Service.

Within  two  weeks,  the  number  of  ground  searchers  ex-
ceeded 3,000. Within a month, more than 4,000 searchers 
were  flown  in  from  around  the  country  to  base  camps  in 
Corsicana,  Palestine,  Nacogdoches,  and  Hemphill,  Texas. 
These searchers, drawn from across the United States and 
Puerto Rico, worked 12 hours per day on 14-, 21-, or 30-day 
rotations and were accompanied by Global Positioning Sys-
tem-equipped NASA and Environmental Protection Agency 
personnel trained to handle and identify debris.

Based on sophisticated mapping of debris trajectories gath-
ered from telemetry, radar, photographs, video, and meteoro-
logical data, as well as reports from the general public, teams 
were  dispatched  to  walk  precise  grids  of  East  Texas  pine 
brush and thicket (see Figure 2.7-2). In lines 10 feet apart, a 
distance calculated to provide a 75 percent probability of de-
tecting a six-inch-square object, wildland firefighters scoured 
snake-infested swamps, mud-filled creek beds, and brush so 
thick that one team advanced only a few hundred feet in an 
entire  morning.  These  20-person  ground  teams  systemati-
cally covered an area two miles to either side of the Orbiterʼs 
ground track. Initial efforts concentrated on the search for 
human remains and the debris corridor between Corsicana, 
Texas, and Fort Polk. Searchers gave highest priority to a list 
of some 20 “hot items” that potentially contained crucial in-
formation, including the Orbiterʼs General Purpose Comput-
ers, film, cameras, and the Modular Auxiliary Data System 
recorder.  Once  the  wildland  firefighters  entered  the  field, 
recovery rates exceeded 1,000 pieces of debris per day.

Figure 2.7-2. Searching for debris was a laborious task that used 
thousands of people walking over hundreds of acres of Texas and 
Louisiana.

After searchers spotted a piece of debris and determined it 
was not hazardous, its location was recorded with a Global 
Positioning System unit and photographed. The debris was 
then tagged and taken to one of four collection centers at 
Corsicana,  Palestine,  Nacogdoches,  and  Hemphill,  Texas. 
There, engineers made a preliminary identification, entered 
the find into a database, and then shipped the debris to Ken-
nedy Space Center, where it was further analyzed in a han-
gar dedicated to the debris reconstruction.

Air Search

Air crews used 37 helicopters and seven fixed-wing aircraft 
to augment ground searchers by searching for debris farther 
out from the Orbiterʼs ground track, from two miles from the 
centerline to five miles on either side. Initially, these crews 
used advanced remote sensing technologies, including two 
satellite  platforms,  hyper-spectral  and  forward-looking  in-
frared scanners, forest penetration radars, and imagery from 
Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Because of the densi-

search claimed the lives of Jules “Buzz” Mier (in black coat) and 
Charles Krenek (yellow coat).

ty of the East Texas vegetation, the small sizes of the debris, 
and the inability of sensors to differentiate Orbiter material 
from other objects, these devices proved of little value. As 
a result, the detection work fell to spotter teams who visu-
ally scanned the terrain. Air search coordinators apportioned 
grids to allow a 50 percent probability of detection for a one-
foot-square object. Civil Air Patrol volunteers and others in 
powered parachutes, a type of ultralight aircraft, also partici-
pated in the search, but were less successful than helicopter 
and fixed-wing air crews in retrieving debris. During the air 
search, a Bell 407 helicopter crashed in Angelina National 
Forest in San Augustine County after a mechanical failure. 
The accident took the lives of Jules F. “Buzz” Mier Jr., a 
contract pilot, and Charles Krenek, a Texas Forest Service 
employee, and injured three others (see Figure 2.7-3). 

Water Search

The  United  States  Navy  Supervisor  of  Salvage  organized 
eight dive teams to search Lake Nacogdoches and Toledo 
Bend Reservoir, two bodies of water in dense debris fields. 
Sonar mapping of more than 31 square miles of lake bottom 
identified more than 3,100 targets in Toledo Bend and 326 
targets in Lake Nacogdoches. Divers explored each target, 
but  in  murky  water  with  visibility  of  only  a  few  inches, 
underwater forests, and other submerged hazards, they re-
covered only one object in Toledo Bend and none in Lake 
Nacogdoches.  The  60  divers  came  from  the  Navy,  Coast 
Guard,  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Texas  Forest 
Service, Texas Department of Public Safety, Houston  and 
Galveston police and fire departments, and Jasper County 
Sheriffʼs Department. 

Search Beyond Texas and Louisiana

As thousands of personnel combed the Orbiterʼs ground track 
in Texas and Louisiana, other civic and community groups 
searched  areas  farther  west.  Environmental  organizations 
and  local  law  enforcement  walked  three  counties  of  Cali-
fornia coastline where oceanographic data indicated a high

probability of debris washing ashore. Prison inmates scoured 
sections of the Nevada desert. Civil Air Patrol units and other 
volunteers searched thousands of acres in New Mexico, by 
air  and  on  foot. Though  these  searchers  failed  to  find  any 
debris, they provided a valuable service by closing out poten-
tial debris sites, including nine areas in Texas, New Mexico, 
Nevada, and Utah identified by the National Transportation 
Safety Board as likely to contain debris. NASAʼs Mishap In-
vestigation Team addressed each of the 1,459 debris reports 
it received. So eager was the general public to turn in pieces 
of potential debris that NASA received reports from 37 U.S. 
states that Columbiaʼs re-entry ground track did not cross, as 
well as from Canada, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.

Property Damage

No one was injured and little property damage resulted from 
the tens of thousands of pieces of falling debris (see Chap-
ter 10). A reimbursement program administered by NASA 
distributed approximately $50,000 to property owners who 
made claims resulting from falling debris or collateral dam-
age from the search efforts. There were, however, a few close 
calls that emphasize the importance of selecting the ground 
track that re-entering Orbiters follow. A 600-pound piece of 
a main engine dug a six-foot-wide hole in the Fort Polk golf 
course, while an 800-pound main engine piece, which hit the 
ground at an estimated 1,400 miles per hour, dug an even 
larger  hole  nearby.  Disaster  was  narrowly  averted  outside 
Nacogdoches when a piece of debris landed between two 
highly explosive natural gas tanks set just feet apart.

Debris Amnesty

The response of the public in reporting and turning in debris 
was outstanding. To reinforce the message that Orbiter de-
bris was government property as well as essential evidence 
of  the  accidentʼs  cause,  NASA  and  local  media  officials 
repeatedly urged local residents to report all debris imme-
diately. For those who might have been keeping debris as 
souvenirs,  NASA  offered  an  amnesty  that  ran  for  several 
days. In the end, only a handful of people were prosecuted 
for theft of debris. 

Final Totals

More than 25,000 people from 270 organizations took part 
in debris recovery operations. All told, searchers expended 
over 1.5 million hours covering more than 2.3 million acres, 
an area approaching the size of Connecticut. Over 700,000 
acres were searched by foot, and searchers found over 84,000 
individual  pieces  of  Orbiter  debris  weighing  more  than 
84,900 pounds, representing 38 percent of the Orbiterʼs dry 
weight. Though significant evidence from radar returns and 
video recordings indicate debris shedding across California, 
Nevada, and New Mexico, the most westerly piece of con-
firmed debris (at the time this report was published) was the 
tile found in a field in Littleton, Texas. Heavier objects with 
higher ballistic coefficients, a measure of how far objects will 
travel in the air, landed toward the end of the debris trail in 
western Louisiana. The most easterly debris pieces, includ-
ing the Space Shuttle Main Engine turbopumps, were found 
in Fort Polk, Louisiana.

Figure  2.7-4.  Recovered  debris  was  returned  to  the  Kennedy 
Space Center where it was laid out in a large hangar. The tape 
on the floor helped workers place each piece near where it had 
been on the Orbiter.

The  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  which  di-
rected the overall effort, expended more than $305 million 
to fund the search. This cost does not include what NASA 
spent on aircraft support or the wages of hundreds of civil 
servants employed at the recovery area and in analysis roles 
at NASA centers. 

The Importance of Debris

The debris collected (see Figure 2.7-4) by searchers aided 
the  investigation  in  significant  ways.  Among  the  most 
important  finds  was  the  Modular  Auxiliary  Data  System 
recorder  that  captured  data  from  hundreds  of  sensors  that 
was  not  telemetered  to  Mission  Control.  Data  from  these 
800 sensors, recorded on 9,400 feet of magnetic tape, pro-
vided investigators with millions of data points, including 
temperature  sensor  readings  from  Columbiaʼs  left  wing 
leading edge. The data also helped fill a 30-second gap in 
telemetered data and provided an additional 14 seconds of 
data after the telemetry loss of signal. 

Recovered debris allowed investigators to build a three-di-
mensional  reconstruction  of  Columbiaʼs  left  wing  leading 
edge,  which  was  the  basis  for  understanding  the  order  in 
which the left wing structure came apart, and led investiga-
tors to determine that heat first entered the wing in the loca-
tion where photo analysis indicated the foam had struck.

liquid hydrogen is very light and its slosh effects are minimal and are 
generally ignored. At launch, the External Tank contains approximately 
1.4 million pounds (140,000 gallons) of liquid oxygen, but only 230,000 
pounds (385,000 gallons) of liquid hydrogen.

developed to meet the Space Station payload lift requirement, a modified

CHAPTER 3

Accident Analysis

One of the central purposes of this investigation, like those 
for  other  kinds  of  accidents,  was  to  identify  the  chain  of 
circumstances  that  caused  the  Columbia  accident.  In  this 
case  the  task  was  particularly  challenging,  because  the 
breakup of the Orbiter occurred at hypersonic velocities and 
extremely high altitudes, and the debris was scattered over 
a wide area. Moreover, the initiating event preceded the ac-
cident by more than two weeks. In pursuit of the sequence of 
the cause, investigators developed a broad array of informa-
tion sources. Evidence was derived from film and video of 
the launch, radar images of Columbia on orbit, and amateur 
video of debris shedding during the in-flight breakup. Data 
was obtained from sensors onboard the Orbiter – some of 
this data was downlinked during the flight, and some came 
from  an  on-board  recorder  that  was  recovered  during  the 
debris search. Analysis of the debris was particularly valu-
able to the investigation. Clues were to be found not only in 
the condition of the pieces, but also in their location – both 
where they had been on the Orbiter and where they were 
found on the ground. The investigation also included exten-
sive computer modeling, impact tests, wind tunnel studies, 
and other analytical techniques. Each of these avenues of 
inquiry is described in this chapter.

Because it became evident that the key event in the chain 
leading to the accident involved both the External Tank and 
one of the Orbiterʼs wings, the chapter includes a study of 
these  two  structures.  The  understanding  of  the  accidentʼs 
physical cause that emerged from this investigation is sum-
marized in the statement at the beginning of the chapter. In-
cluded in the chapter are the findings and recommendations 
of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that are based 
on this examination of the physical evidence.
3.1  THE PHYSICAL CAUSE

The  physical  cause  of  the  loss  of  Columbia  and  its 
crew was a breach in the Thermal Protection System 
on the leading edge of the left wing. The breach was 
initiated by a piece of insulating foam that separated 
from  the  left  bipod  ramp  of  the  External  Tank  and 
struck the wing in the vicinity of the lower half of Rein-
forced Carbon-Carbon panel 8 at 81.9 seconds after 
launch.  During  re-entry,  this  breach  in  the  Thermal 

Protection  System  allowed  superheated  air  to  pen-
etrate  the  leading-edge  insulation  and  progressively 
melt the aluminum structure of the left wing, resulting 
in a weakening of the structure until increasing aero-
dynamic forces caused loss of control, failure of the 
wing, and breakup of the Orbiter.

3.2  THE EXTERNAL TANK AND FOAM

The External Tank is the largest element of the Space Shuttle. 
Because it is the common element to which the Solid Rocket 
Boosters and the Orbiter are connected, it serves as the main 
structural component during assembly, launch, and ascent. 
It also fulfills the role of the low-temperature, or cryogenic, 
propellant tank for the Space Shuttle Main Engines. It holds 
143,351  gallons  of  liquid  oxygen  at  minus  297  degrees 
Fahrenheit in its forward (upper) tank and 385,265 gallons 
of liquid hydrogen at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit in its aft 
(lower) tank.1

Figure 3.2-1. The major components of the External Tank.

Lockheed Martin builds the External Tank under contract to 
the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center at the Michoud As-
sembly Facility in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana.

The External Tank is constructed primarily of aluminum al-
loys (mainly 2219 aluminum alloy for standard-weight and 
lightweight  tanks,  and  2195 Aluminum-Lithium  alloy  for 
super-lightweight tanks), with steel and titanium fittings and 
attach points, and some composite materials in fairings and 
access panels. The External Tank is 153.8 feet long and 27.6 
feet in diameter, and comprises three major sections: the liq-
uid oxygen tank, the liquid hydrogen tank, and the intertank 
area between them (see Figure 3.2-1). The liquid oxygen and 
liquid hydrogen tanks are welded assemblies of machined 
and formed panels, barrel sections, ring frames, and dome 
and ogive sections. The liquid oxygen tank is pressure-tested 
with water, and the liquid hydrogen tank with compressed air, 
before they are incorporated into the External Tank assembly. 
STS-107 used Lightweight External Tank-93.

The propellant tanks are connected by the intertank, a 22.5-
foot-long hollow cylinder made of eight stiffened aluminum 
alloy panels bolted together along longitudinal joints. Two of 
these panels, the integrally stiffened thrust panels (so called 
because they react to the Solid Rocket Booster thrust loads) 
are located on the sides of the External Tank where the Solid 
Rocket Boosters are mounted; they consist of single slabs of 
aluminum alloy machined into panels with solid longitudinal 
ribs. The thrust panels are joined across the inner diameter 
by  the  intertank  truss,  the  major  structural  element  of  the 
External Tank. During propellant loading, nitrogen is used to 
purge the intertank to prevent condensation and also to pre-
vent liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen from combining.

The External Tank is attached to the Solid Rocket Boosters 
by bolts and fittings on the thrust panels and near the aft end 
of the liquid hydrogen tank. The Orbiter is attached to the Ex-

ternal Tank by two umbilical fittings at the bottom (that also 
contain fluid and electrical connections) and by a “bipod” at 
the top. The bipod is attached to the External Tank by fittings 
at the right and left of the External Tank centerline. The bipod 
fittings, which are titanium forgings bolted to the External 
Tank, are forward (above) of the intertank-liquid hydrogen 
flange joint (see Figures 3.2-2 and 3.2-3). Each forging con-
tains a spindle that attaches to one end of a bipod strut and 
rotates to compensate for External Tank shrinkage during the 
loading of cryogenic propellants.

External Tank Thermal Protection System Materials

The External Tank is coated with two materials that serve 
as the Thermal Protection System: dense composite ablators 
for dissipating heat, and low density closed-cell foams for 
high  insulation  efficiency.2  (Closed-cell  materials  consist 
of  small  pores  filled  with  air  and  blowing  agents  that  are 
separated by thin membranes of the foamʼs polymeric com-
ponent.) The External Tank Thermal Protection System is 
designed to maintain an interior temperature that keeps the

oxygen and hydrogen in a liquid state, and to maintain the 
temperature of external parts high enough to prevent ice and 
frost from forming on the surface. Figure 3.2-4 summarizes 
the foam systems used on the External Tank for STS-107.

The adhesion between sprayed-on foam insulation and the 
External Tankʼs aluminum substrate is actually quite good, 
provided that the substrate has been properly cleaned and 
primed. (Poor surface preparation does not appear to have 
been a problem in the past.) In addition, large areas of the 
aluminum substrate are usually heated during foam appli-
cation to ensure that the foam cures properly and develops 
the maximum adhesive strength. The interface between the 
foam and the aluminum substrate experiences stresses due 
to  differences  in  how  much  the  aluminum  and  the  foam 
contract when subjected to cryogenic temperatures, and due 
to the stresses on the External Tankʼs aluminum structure 
while it serves as the backbone of the Shuttle stack. While 
these stresses at the foam-aluminum interface are certainly 
not trivial, they do not appear to be excessive, since very few 
of the observed foam loss events indicated that the foam was 
lost down to the primed aluminum substrate.

Throughout the history of the External Tank, factors unre-
lated to the insulation process have caused foam chemistry 
changes (Environmental Protection Agency regulations and 
material availability, for example). The most recent changes 
resulted from modifications to governmental regulations of 
chlorofluorocarbons. 

Most of the External Tank is insulated with three types of 
spray-on foam. NCFI 24-124, a polyisocyanurate foam ap-
plied with blowing agent HCFC 141b hydrochlorofluorocar-

bon, is used on most areas of the liquid oxygen and liquid 
hydrogen  tanks.  NCFI  24-57,  another  polyisocyanurate 
foam  applied  with  blowing  agent  HCFC  141b  hydrochlo-
rofluorocarbon, is used on the lower liquid hydrogen tank 
dome. BX-250, a polyurethane foam applied with CFC-11 
chlorofluorocarbon, was used on domes, ramps, and areas 
where the foam is applied by hand. The foam types changed 
on External Tanks built after External Tank 93, which was 
used on STS-107, but these changes are beyond the scope of 
this section.

Metallic sections of the External Tank that will be insulated 
with foam are first coated with an epoxy primer. In some 
areas, such as on the bipod hand-sculpted regions, foam is 
applied directly over ablator materials. Where foam is ap-
plied over cured or dried foam, a bonding enhancer called 
Conathane is first applied to aid the adhesion between the 
two foam coats.

After foam is applied in the intertank region, the larger areas 
of foam coverage are machined down to a thickness of about 
an inch. Since controlling weight is a major concern for the 
External Tank, this machining serves to reduce foam thick-
ness while still maintaining sufficient insulation.

The  insulated  region  where  the  bipod  struts  attach  to  the 
External Tank is structurally, geometrically, and materially 
complex. Because of concerns that foam applied over the 
fittings would not provide enough protection from the high 
heating of exposed surfaces during ascent, the bipod fittings 
are coated with ablators. BX-250 foam is sprayed by hand 
over the fittings (and ablator materials), allowed to dry, and 
manually shaved into a ramp shape. The foam is visually

inspected at the Michoud Assembly Facility and also at the 
Kennedy Space Center, but no other non-destructive evalu-
ation is performed. 

Since the Shuttleʼs inaugural flight, the shape of the bipod 
ramp has changed twice. The bipod foam ramps on External 
Tanks 1 through 13 originally had a 45-degree ramp angle. 
On  STS-7,  foam  was  lost  from  the  External  Tank  bipod 
ramp; subsequent wind tunnel testing showed that shallower 
angles  were  aerodynamically  preferable.  The  ramp  angle 
was changed from 45 degrees to between 22 and 30 degrees 
on External Tank 14 and later tanks. A slight modification 
to the ramp impingement profile, implemented on External 
Tank 76 and later, was the last ramp geometry change. 

STS-107 Left Bipod Foam Ramp Loss

A combination of factors, rather than a single factor, led to the 
loss of the left bipod foam ramp during the ascent of STS-107.
NASA personnel believe that testing conducted during the 
investigation, including the dissection of as-built hardware 
and testing of simulated defects, showed conclusively that 
pre-existing defects in the foam were a major factor, and in 
briefings to the Board, these were cited as a necessary condi-
tion for foam loss. However, analysis indicated that pre-ex-
isting defects alone were not responsible for foam loss.

The basic External Tank was designed more than 30 years 
ago.  The  design  process  then  was  substantially  different 
than it is today. In the 1970s, engineers often developed par-
ticular facets of a design (structural, thermal, and so on) one 
after another and in relative isolation from other engineers 
working on different facets. Today, engineers usually work 
together  on  all  aspects  of  a  design  as  an  integrated  team. 
The bipod fitting was designed first from a structural stand-
point, and the application processes for foam (to prevent ice 
formation) and Super Lightweight Ablator (to protect from 
high heating) were developed separately. Unfortunately, the 
structurally optimum fitting design, along with the geomet-
ric complexity of its location (near the flange between the in-
tertank and the liquid hydrogen tank), posed many problems 
in the application of foam and Super Lightweight Ablator 
that would lead to foam-ramp defects.

Although  there  is  no  evidence  that  substandard  methods 
were used to qualify the bipod ramp design, tests made near-
ly three decades ago were rudimentary by todayʼs standards 
and capabilities. Also, testing did not follow the often-used 
engineering and design philosophy of “Fly what you test and 
test what you fly.” Wind tunnel tests observed the aerody-
namics and strength of two geometries of foam bipod enclo-
sures (flat-faced and a 20-degree ramp), but these tests were 
done on essentially solid foam blocks that were not sprayed 
onto the complex bipod fitting geometry. Extensive mate-
rial property tests gauged the strength, insulating potential, 
and ablative characteristics of foam and Super Lightweight 
Ablator specimens.

It was – and still is – impossible to conduct a ground-based, 
simultaneous,  full-scale  simulation  of  the  combination 
of  loads,  airflows,  temperatures,  pressures,  vibration,  and 
acoustics the External Tank experiences during launch and 

ascent. Therefore, the qualification testing did not truly re-
flect the combination of factors the bipod would experience 
during flight. Engineers and designers used the best meth-
ods available at the time: test the bipod and foam under as 
many severe combinations as could be simulated and then 
interpolate the results. Various analyses determined stresses, 
thermal gradients, air loads, and other conditions that could 
not be obtained through testing.

Significant analytical advancements have been made since 
the External Tank was first conceived, particularly in com-
putational fluid dynamics (see Figure 3.2-5). Computational 
fluid dynamics comprises a computer-generated model that 
represents  a  system  or  device  and  uses  fluid-flow  physics 
and  software  to  create  predictions  of  flow  behavior,  and 
stress or deformation of solid structures. However, analysis 
must always be verified by test and/or flight data. The Exter-
nal Tank and the bipod ramp were not tested in the complex 
flight  environment,  nor  were  fully  instrumented  External 
Tanks ever launched to gather data for verifying analytical 
tools. The accuracy of the analytical tools used to simulate 
the External Tank and bipod ramp were verified only by us-
ing flight and test data from other Space Shuttle regions.

Figure 3.2-5. Computational  Fluid  Dynamics  was used  to under-

present  when  the  left  bipod  foam  ramp  was  lost  from  External 
Tank 93 at Mach 2.46 at a 2.08-degree angle of attack.

Further complicating this problem, foam does not have the 
same properties in all directions, and there is also variability 
in the foam itself. Because it consists of small hollow cells, 
it does not have the same composition at every point. This 
combination  of  properties  and  composition  makes  foam 
extremely difficult to model analytically or to characterize 
physically. The great variability in its properties makes for 
difficulty in predicting its response in even relatively static 
conditions,  much  less  during  the  launch  and  ascent  of  the 
Shuttle.  And  too  little  effort  went  into  understanding  the 
origins of this variability and its failure modes.

The way the foam was produced and applied, particularly 
in the bipod region, also contributed to its variability. Foam 
consists  of  two  chemical  components  that  must  be  mixed 
in  an  exact  ratio  and  is  then  sprayed  according  to  strict 
specifications. Foam is applied to the bipod fitting by hand 
to make the foam ramp, and this process may be the primary 
source  of  foam  variability.  Board-directed  dissection  of 
foam ramps has revealed that defects (voids, pockets, and 
debris) are likely due to a lack of control of various combi-
nations of parameters in spray-by-hand applications, which

is exacerbated by the complexity of the underlying hardware 
configuration. These defects often occur along “knit lines,” 
the boundaries between each layer that are formed by the 
repeated application of thin layers – a detail of the spray-by-
hand process that contributes to foam variability, suggesting 
that  while  foam  is  sprayed  according  to  approved  proce-
dures, these procedures may be questionable if the people 
who devised them did not have a sufficient understanding of 
the properties of the foam.

Subsurface defects can be detected only by cutting away the 
foam  to  examine  the  interior.  Non-destructive  evaluation 
techniques  for  determining  External  Tank  foam  strength 
have not been perfected or qualified (although non-destruc-
tive  testing  has  been  used  successfully  on  the  foam  on 
Boeingʼs new Delta IV booster, a design of much simpler 
geometry than the External Tank). Therefore, it has been im-
possible to determine the quality of foam bipod ramps on any 
External Tank. Furthermore, multiple defects in some cases 
can combine to weaken the foam along a line or plane.
 
“Cryopumping”  has  long  been  theorized  as  one  of  the 
processes  contributing  to  foam  loss  from  larger  areas  of 
coverage. If there are cracks in the foam, and if these cracks 
lead through the foam to voids at or near the surface of the 
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks, then air, chilled 
by the extremely low temperatures of the cryogenic tanks, 
can liquefy in the voids. After launch, as propellant levels 
fall and aerodynamic heating of the exterior increases, the 
temperature of the trapped air can increase, leading to boil-
ing and evaporation of the liquid, with concurrent buildup of 
pressure within the foam. It was believed that the resulting 
rapid increase in subsurface pressure could cause foam to 
break away from the External Tank.
 
“Cryoingestion”  follows  essentially  the  same  scenario, 
except it involves gaseous nitrogen seeping out of the in-
tertank and liquefying inside a foam void or collecting in 
the Super Lightweight Ablator. (The intertank is filled with 
nitrogen during tanking operations to prevent condensation 
and also to prevent liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from 
combining.)  Liquefying  would  most  likely  occur  in  the 
circumferential “Y” joint, where the liquid hydrogen tank 
mates with the intertank, just above the liquid hydrogen-in-
tertank flange. The bipod foam ramps straddle this complex 
feature. If pooled liquid nitrogen contacts the liquid hydro-
gen tank, it can solidify, because the freezing temperature 
of liquid nitrogen (minus 348 degrees Fahrenheit) is higher 
than the temperature of liquid hydrogen (minus 423 degrees 
Fahrenheit). As  with  cryopumping,  cryoingested  liquid  or 
solid  nitrogen  could  also  “flash  evaporate”  during  launch 
and ascent, causing the foam to crack off. Several paths al-
low gaseous nitrogen to escape from the intertank, including 
beneath  the  flange,  between  the  intertank  panels,  through 
the rivet holes that connect stringers to intertank panels, and 
through vent holes beneath the stringers that prevent over-
pressurization of the stringers.

No  evidence  suggests  that  defects  or  cryo-effects  alone 
caused  the  loss  of  the  left  bipod  foam  ramp  from  the 
STS-107 External Tank. Indeed, NASA calculations have 
suggested that during ascent, the Super Lightweight Ablator 

remains just slightly above the temperature at which nitro-
gen liquefies, and that the outer wall of the hydrogen tank 
near the bipod ramp does not reach the temperature at which 
nitrogen boils until 150 seconds into the flight,3 which is too 
late to explain the only two bipod ramp foam losses whose 
times during ascent are known. Recent tests at the Marshall 
Space  Flight  Center  revealed  that  flight  conditions  could 
permit  ingestion  of  nitrogen  or  air  into  subsurface  foam, 
but would not permit “flash evaporation” and a sufficient 
subsurface  pressure  increase  to  crack  the  foam.  When 
conditions  are  modified  to  force  a  flash  evaporation,  the 
failure mode in the foam is a crack that provides pressure 
relief rather than explosive cracking. Therefore, the flight 
environment itself must also have played a role. Aerody-
namic loads, thermal and vacuum effects, vibrations, stress 
in the External Tank structure, and myriad other conditions 
may have contributed to the growth of subsurface defects, 
weakening the foam ramp until it could no longer withstand 
flight conditions. 

Conditions in certain combinations during ascent may also 
have contributed to the loss of the foam ramp, even if in-
dividually they were well within design certification limits. 
These include a wind shear, associated Solid Rocket Booster 
and Space Shuttle Main Engine responses, and liquid oxy-
gen sloshing in the External Tank.4 Each of these conditions, 
alone,  does  not  appear  to  have  caused  the  foam  loss,  but 
their contribution to the event in combination is unknown.

Negligence on the part of NASA, Lockheed Martin, or United 
Space Alliance workers does not appear to have been a fac-
tor. There is no evidence of sabotage, either during produc-
tion or pre-launch. Although a Problem Report was written 
for a small area of crushed foam near the left bipod (a condi-
tion on nearly every flight), this affected only a very small 
region and does not appear to have contributed to the loss of 
the ramp (see Chapter 4 for a fuller discussion). Nor does the 
basic quality of the foam appear to be a concern. Many of the 
basic components are continually and meticulously tested for 
quality before they are applied. Finally, despite commonly 
held perceptions, numerous tests show that moisture absorp-
tion and ice formation in the foam appears negligible.

Foam loss has occurred on more than 80 percent of the 79 
missions for which imagery is available, and foam was lost 
from the left bipod ramp on nearly 10 percent of missions 
where  the  left  bipod  ramp  was  visible  following  External 
Tank separation. For about 30 percent of all missions, there 
is no way to determine if foam was lost; these were either 
night launches, or the External Tank bipod ramp areas were 
not in view when the images were taken. The External Tank 
was  not  designed  to  be  instrumented  or  recovered  after 
separation, which deprives NASA of physical evidence that 
could help pinpoint why foam separates from it. 

The precise reasons why the left bipod foam ramp was lost 
from the External Tank during STS-107 may never be known. 
The specific initiating event may likewise remain a mystery. 
However,  it  is  evident  that  a  combination  of  variable  and 
pre-existing factors, such as insufficient testing and analysis 
in the early design stages, resulted in a highly variable and 
complex  foam  material,  defects  induced  by  an  imperfect

FOAM FRACTURE UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE

The Board has concluded that the physical cause of the breakup of 
Columbia upon re-entry was the result of damage to the Orbiterʼs 
Thermal Protection System, which occurred when a large piece of 
BX-250 foam insulation fell from the left (–Y) bipod assembly 81.7 
seconds after launch and struck the leading edge of the left wing. As 
the External Tank is covered with insulating foam, it seemed to me 
essential that we understand the mechanisms that could cause foam 
to shed. 

Many  if  not  most  of  the  systems  in  the  three  components  of  the 
Shuttle stack (Orbiter, External Tank, and Solid Rocket Boosters) are 
by themselves complex, and often operate near the limits of their per-
formance. Attempts to understand their complex behavior and failure 
modes are hampered by their strong interactions with other systems 
in the stack, through their shared environment. The foam of the Ther-
mal Protection System is no exception. To understand the behavior 
of systems under such circumstances, one must first understand their 
behavior in relatively simple limits. Using this understanding as a 
guide, one is much more likely to determine the mechanisms of com-
plex behavior, such as the shedding of foam from the –Y bipod ramp, 
than simply creating simulations of the complex behavior itself.

I approached this problem by trying to imagine the fracture mecha-
nism by which fluid pressure built up inside the foam could propagate 
to the surface. Determining this process is clearly key to understand-
ing foam ejection through the heating of cryogenic fluids trapped in 
voids beneath the surface of the foam, either through “cryopumping” 
or “cryoingestion.” I started by imagining a fluid under hydrostatic 
pressure in contact with the surface of such foam. It seemed clear 
that as the pressure increased, it would cause the weakest cell wall 
to burst, filling the adjacent cell with the fluid, and exerting the same 
hydrostatic pressure on all the walls of that cell. What happened next 
was unclear. It was possible that the next cell wall to burst would not 
be one of the walls of the newly filled cell, but some other cell that 
had been on the surface that was initially subjected to the fluid pres-
sure. This seemed like a rather complex process, and I questioned my 
ability to include all the physics correctly if I tried to model it. In-
stead, I chose to perform an experiment that seemed straightforward, 
but which had a result I could not have foreseen.

I glued a 1.25-inch-thick piece of BX-250 foam to a 0.25-inch-thick 
brass plate. The 3-by-3-inch plate had a 0.25-inch-diameter hole in 
its center, into which a brass tube was soldered. The tube was filled 
with a liquid dye, and the air pressure above the dye could be slowly 
raised, using a battery-operated tire pump to which a pressure regu-
lator was attached until the fluid was forced through the foam to its 
outer surface. Not knowing what to expect, the first time I tried this 
experiment  with  my  graduate  student,  Jim  Baumgardner,  we  did 
so out on the loading dock of the Stanford Physics Department. If 
this process were to mimic the cryoejection of foam, we expected 
a violent explosion when the pressure burst through the surface. To 
keep from being showered with dye, we put the assembly in a closed 
cardboard box, and donned white lab coats. 

Instead of a loud explosion, we heard nothing. We found, though, that 
the pressure above the liquid began dropping once the gas pressure 
reached about 45 pounds per square inch. Releasing the pressure and 
opening the box, we found a thin crack, about a half-inch long, at the 
upper surface of the foam. Curious about the path the pressure had 
taken to reach the surface, I cut the foam off the brass plate, and made 
two vertical cuts through the foam in line with the crack. When I bent 
the foam in line with the crack, it separated into two sections along 
the crack. The dye served as a tracer for where the fluid had traveled 
in its path through the foam. This path was along a flat plane, and was 

the shape of a teardrop that intersected perpendicular to the upper 
surface of the foam. Since the pressure could only exert force in the 
two directions perpendicular to this fault plane, it could not possibly 
result in the ejection of foam, because that would require a force per-
pendicular to the surface of the foam. I repeated this experiment with 
several pieces of foam and always found the same behavior.

I was curious why the path of the pressure fault was planar, and why 
it had propagated upward, nearly perpendicular to the outer surface 
of the foam. For this sample, and most of the samples that NASA 
had given me, the direction of growth of the foam was vertical, as 
evidenced by horizontal “knit lines” that result from successive ap-
plications of the sprayed foam. The knit lines are perpendicular to 
the growth direction. I then guessed that the growth of the pressure 
fault was influenced by the foamʼs direction of growth. To test this 
hypothesis, I found a piece of foam for which the growth direction 
was vertical near the top surface of the foam, but was at an approxi-
mately 45-degree angle to the vertical near the bottom. If my hypoth-
esis were correct, the direction of growth of the pressure fault would 
follow the direction of growth of the foam, and hence would always 
intersect the knit lines at 90 degrees. Indeed, this was the case. 

The reason the pressure fault is planar has to do with the fact that 
such  a  geometry  can  amplify  the  fluid  pressure,  creating  a  much 
greater stress on the cell walls near the outer edges of the teardrop, 
for  a  given  hydrostatic  pressure,  than  would  exist  for  a  spherical 
pressure-filled void. A pressure fault follows the direction of foam 
growth because more cell walls have their surfaces along this direc-
tion than along any other. The stiffness of the foam is highest when 
you apply a force parallel to the cell walls. If you squeeze a cube of 
foam in various directions, you find that the foam is stiffest along its 
growth direction. By advancing along the stiff direction, the crack is 
oriented so that the fluid pressure can more easily force the (nearly) 
planar walls of the crack apart.

Because the pressure fault intersects perpendicular to the upper sur-
face, hydrostatic pressure will generally not lead to foam shedding. 
There are, however, cases where pressure can lead to foam shedding, 
but this will only occur when the fluid pressure exists over an area 
whose dimensions are large compared to the thickness of the foam 
above it, and roughly parallel to the outer surface. This would require 
a large structural defect within the foam, such as the delamination 
of the foam from its substrate or the separation of the foam at a knit 
line. Such large defects are quite different from the small voids that 
occur when gravity causes uncured foam to “roll over” and trap a 
small bubble of air.

Experiments like this help us understand how foam shedding does 
(and doesnʼt) occur, because they elucidate the properties of “per-
fect” foam, free from voids and other defects. Thus, this behavior 
represents the true behavior of the foam, free from defects that may 
or may not have been present. In addition, these experiments are fast 
and cheap, since they can be carried out on relatively small pieces of 
foam in simple environments. Finally, we can understand why the 
observed behavior occurs from our understanding of the basic physi-
cal properties of the foam itself. By contrast, if you wish to mimic 
left bipod foam loss, keep in mind that such loss could have been 
detected only 7 times in 72 instances. Thus, not observing foam loss 
in a particular experiment will not insure that it would never happen 
under the same conditions at a later time. NASA is now undertaking 
both kinds of experiments, but it is the simple studies that so far have 
most contributed to our understanding of foam failure modes.

F3.2−1  NASA does not fully understand the mechanisms 
that  cause  foam  loss  on  almost  all  flights  from 
larger areas of foam coverage and from areas that 
are sculpted by hand.
There are no qualified non-destructive evaluation 
techniques for the as-installed foam to determine 
the characteristics of the foam before flight.
Foam loss from an External Tank is unrelated to 
the tankʼs age and to its total pre-launch expo-
sure to the elements. Therefore, the foam loss on 
STS-107 is unrelated to either the age or expo-
sure of External Tank 93 before launch.
The  Board  found  no  indications  of  negligence 
in the application of the External Tank Thermal 
Protection System.
The  Board  found  instances  of  left  bipod  ramp 
shedding on launch that NASA was not aware of, 
bringing the total known left bipod ramp shed-
ding events to 7 out of 72 missions for which im-
agery of the launch or External Tank separation 
is available.
Subsurface defects were found during the dissec-
tion of three bipod foam ramps, suggesting that 
similar defects were likely present in the left bi-
pod ramp of External Tank 93 used on STS-107.
Foam loss occurred on more than 80 percent of 
the 79 missions for which imagery was available 
to confirm or rule out foam loss.
Thirty  percent  of  all  missions  lacked  sufficient 
imagery to determine if foam had been lost.

F3.2−9  Analysis  of  numerous  separate  variables  indi-
cated  that  none  could  be  identified  as  the  sole 
initiating factor of bipod foam loss. The Board 
therefore concludes that a combination of several 
factors resulted in bipod foam loss.

missions with minimal refurbishment, maintaining the alu-
minum wing structure at less than 350 degrees Fahrenheit, 
withstanding a kinetic energy impact of 0.006 foot-pounds, 
and the ability to withstand 1.4 times the load ever expected 
in operation.5 The requirements specifically stated that the 

REINFORCED CARBON-CARBON (RCC)
The basic RCC composite is a laminate of graphite-impreg-
nated rayon fabric, further impregnated with phenolic resin 
and layered, one ply at a time, in a unique mold for each part, 
then cured, rough-trimmed, drilled, and inspected. The part 
is then packed in calcined coke and fired in a furnace to con-
vert it to carbon and is made more dense by three cycles of 
furfuryl alcohol vacuum impregnation and firing.

To prevent oxidation, the outer layers of the carbon substrate 
are converted into a 0.02-to-0.04-inch-thick layer of silicon 
carbide  in  a  chamber  filled  with  argon  at  temperatures  up 
to  3,000  degrees  Fahrenheit. As  the  silicon  carbide  cools, 
“craze cracks” form because the thermal expansion rates of 
the silicon carbide and the carbon substrate differ. The part is 
then repeatedly vacuum-impregnated with tetraethyl ortho-
silicate to fill the pores in the substrate, and the craze cracks 
are filled with a sealant.

wing leading edge would not need to withstand impact from 
debris or ice, since these objects would not pose a threat dur-
ing the launch phase.6

Reinforced Carbon-Carbon

The development of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) as 
part of the Thermal Protection System was key to meeting 
the wing leading edge design requirements. Developed by 
Ling-Temco-Vought  (now  Lockheed  Martin  Missiles  and 
Fire Control), RCC is used for the Orbiter nose cap, chin 
panel,  forward  External  Tank  attachment  point,  and  wing 
leading edge panels and T-seals. RCC is a hard structural 
material,  with  reasonable  strength  across  its  operational 
temperature range (minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit to 3,000 
degrees). Its low thermal expansion coefficient minimizes 
thermal shock and thermoelastic stress. 

Each  wing  leading  edge  consists  of  22  RCC  panels  (see 
Figure 3.3-1), numbered from 1 to 22 moving outward on 
each wing (the nomenclature is “5-left” or “5-right” to dif-
ferentiate, for example, the two number 5 panels). Because 
the  shape  of  the  wing  changes  from  inboard  to  outboard, 
each panel is unique.

Wing Leading Edge Damage 

Leading Edge Maintenance

The  risk  of  micrometeoroid  or  debris  damage  to  the  RCC 
panels has been evaluated several times. Hypervelocity im-
pact  testing,  using  nylon,  glass,  and  aluminum  projectiles, 
as well as low-velocity impact testing with ice, aluminum, 
steel, and lead projectiles, resulted in the addition of a 0.03- to 
0.06-inch-thick layer of Nextel-440 fabric between the Inco-
nel foil and Cerachrome insulation. Analysis of the design 
change predicts that the Orbiter could survive re-entry with 
a quarter-inch diameter hole in the lower surfaces of RCC 
panels 8 through 10 or with a one-inch hole in the rest of the 
RCC panels. 

RCC components have been struck by objects throughout 
their operational life, but none of these components has been 
completely penetrated. A sampling of 21 post-flight reports 
noted 43 hypervelocity impacts, the largest being 0.2 inch. 
The  most  significant  low-velocity  impact  was  to  Atlantisʼ 
panel 10-right during STS-45 in March and April 1992. The 
damaged area was 1.9 inches by 1.6 inches on the exterior 
surface and 0.5 inches by 0.1 inches in the interior surface. 
The substrate was exposed and oxidized, and the panel was 
scrapped. Analysis concluded that the damage was caused 
by a strike by a man-made object, possibly during ascent. 
Figures 3.3-2 and 3.3-3 show the damage to the outer and 
inner surfaces, respectively.

Figure 3.3-2. Damage on the outer surface of RCC panel 10-right 
from Atlantis after STS-45.

Figure 3.3-3. Damage on the inner surface of RCC panel 10-right 
from Atlantis after STS-45.

Post-flight  RCC  component  inspections  for  cracks,  chips, 
scratches, pinholes, and abnormal discoloration are primar-
ily visual, with tactile evaluations (pushing with a finger) 
of some regions. Boeing personnel at the Kennedy Space 
Center make minor repairs to the silicon carbide coating and 
surface defects.

With the goal of a long service life, panels 6 through 17 are 
refurbished every 18 missions, and panels 18 and 19 every 
36 missions. The remaining panels have no specific refur-
bishment requirement.

At  the  time  of  STS-107,  most  of  the  RCC  panels  on 
Columbiaʼs  left  wing  were  original  equipment,  but  panel 
10-left, T-seal 10-left, panel 11-left, and T-seal 11-left had 
been replaced (along with panel 12 on the right wing). Panel 
10-left was tested to destruction after 19 flights. Minor sur-
face repairs had been made to panels 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 
19 and T-seals 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 19. Panels and T-seals 
6 through 9 and 11 through 17 of the left wing had been 
refurbished. 

Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Mission Life

The rate of oxidation is the most important variable in de-
termining the mission life of RCC components. Oxidation 
of the carbon substrate results when oxygen penetrates the 
microscopic pores or fissures of the silicon carbide protec-
tive coating. The subsequent loss of mass due to oxidation 
reduces the load the structure can carry and is the basis for 
establishing a mission life limit. The oxidation rate is a func-
tion of temperature, pressure, time, and the type of heating. 
Repeated exposure to the Orbiterʼs normal flight environ-
ment degrades the protective coating system and accelerates 
the loss of mass, which weakens components and reduces 
mission life capability.

Currently, mass loss of flown RCC components cannot be 
directly measured. Instead, mass loss and mission life reduc-
tion are predicted analytically using a methodology based on 
mass loss rates experimentally derived in simulated re-entry 
environments.  This  approach  then  uses  derived  re-entry 
temperature-time profiles of various portions of RCC com-
ponents to estimate the actual re-entry mass loss.

For the first five missions of  Columbia, the RCC compo-
nents were not coated with Type A sealant, and had shorter 
mission  service  lives  than  the  RCC  components  on  the 
other  Orbiters.  (Columbiaʼs  panel  9  has  the  shortest  mis-
sion service life of 50 flights as shown in Figure 3.3-4.) The 
predicted life for panel/T-seals 7 through 16 range from 54 
to 97 flights.7 

Localized  penetration  of  the  protective  coating  on  RCC 
components (pinholes) were first discovered on Columbia in 
1992, after STS-50, Columbiaʼs 12th flight. Pinholes were 
later found in all Orbiters, and their quantity and size have 
increased  as  flights  continue.  Tests  showed  that  pinholes 
were  caused  by  zinc  oxide  contamination  from  a  primer 
used on the launch pad.

Panel/T-Seal Assembly

Figure 3.3-4. The expected mission life for each of the wing lead-
ing  edge  RCC  panels  on  Columbia.  Note  that  panel  9  has  the 
shortest life expectancy.

In October 1993, panel 12-right was removed from Columbia
 after its 15th flight for destructive evaluation. Optical and 
scanning electron microscope examinations of 15 pinholes 
revealed that a majority occurred along craze cracks in the 
thick  regions  of  the  silicon  carbide  layer.  Pinhole  glass 
chemistry  revealed  the  presence  of  zinc,  silicon,  oxygen, 
and aluminum. There is no zinc in the leading edge sup-
port system, but the launch pad corrosion protection system 
uses an inorganic zinc primer under a coat of paint, and this 
coat of paint is not always refurbished after a launch. Rain 
samples  from  the  Rotating  Support  Structure  at  Launch 
Complex 39-A in July 1994 confirmed that rain washed the 
unprotected primer off the service structure and deposited it 
on RCC panels while the Orbiter sat on the launch pad. At 
the request of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, 
rain samples were again collected in May 2003. The zinc 

LEFT WING AND WING LEADING EDGE

The Orbiter wing leading edge structural subsystem consists of 
the RCC panels, the upper and lower access panels (also called 
carrier panels), and the associated attachment hardware for each 
of these components. 

On Columbia, two upper and lower A-286 stainless steel spar 
attachment fittings connected each RCC panel to the aluminum 
wing leading edge spar. On later Orbiters, each upper and lower 
spar attachment fitting is a one-piece assembly. 

The space between each RCC panel is covered by a gap seal, 
also  known  as  a  T-seal.  Each  T-seal,  also  manufactured  from 
RCC, is attached to its associated RCC panel by two Inconel 718 
attachment clevises. The upper and lower carrier panels, which 
allow access behind each RCC panel, are attached to the spar at-
tachment fittings after the RCC panels and T-seals are installed. 
The lower carrier panel prevents superheated air from entering 

the RCC panel cavity. A small space between the upper carrier 
panel and the RCC panel allows air pressure to equalize behind 
the RCC panels during ascent and re-entry. 

The mid-wing area on the left wing, behind where the breach 
occurred, is supported by a series of trusses, as shown in red 
in the figure below. The mid-wing area is bounded in the front 
and back by the Xo1040 and Xo1191 cross spars, respectively. 
The numerical designation of each spar comes from its location 
along  the  Orbiterʼs  X-axis;  for  example,  the  Xo1040  spar  is 
1,040 inches from the zero point on the X-axis. The cross spars 
provide the wingʼs structural integrity. Three major cross spars 
behind the Xo1191 spar provide the primary structural strength 
for the aft portion of the wing. The inboard portion of the mid-
wing is the outer wall of the left wheel-well, and the outboard 
portion of the mid-wing is the wing leading edge spar, where the 
RCC panels attach.

The major internal support structures in the mid-wing are con-
structed from aluminum alloy. Since aluminum melts at 1,200 
degrees Fahrenheit, it is likely these truss tubes in the mid-wing 
were destroyed and wing structural integrity was lost.

fallout  rate  was  generally  less  than  previously  recorded 
except for one location, which had the highest rate of zinc 
fallout of all the samples from both evaluations. Chemical 
analysis of the most recent rainwater samples determined 
the percentage of zinc to be consistently around nine per-
cent, with that one exception. 

Specimens with pinholes were fabricated from RCC panel 
12-right  and  arc-jet-tested,  but  the  arc-jet  testing  did  not 
substantially  change  the  pinhole  dimensions  or  substrate 
oxidation. (Arc jet testing is done in a wind tunnel with an 
electrical arc that provides an airflow of up to 2,800 degrees 
Fahrenheit.)  As  a  result  of  the  pinhole  investigation,  the 
sealant refurbishment process was revised to include clean-
ing the part in a vacuum at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit to bake 
out contaminants like zinc oxide and salt, and forcing seal-
ant into pinholes. 

Post-flight analysis of RCC components confirms that seal-
ant is ablated during each mission, which increases subsur-
face oxidation and reduces component strength and mission 
life. Based on the destructive evaluation of Columbiaʼs pan-
el 12-right and various arc-jet tests, refurbishment intervals 
were established to achieve the desired service life.

In November 2001, white residue was discovered on about 
half the RCC panels on Columbia, Atlantis, and Endeavour.
Investigations revealed that the deposits were sodium car-
bonate  that  resulted  from  the  exposure  of  sealant  to  rain-
water,  with  three  possible  outcomes:  (1)  the  deposits  are 
washed off, which decreases sealant effectiveness; (2) the 
deposits remain on the partʼs surface, melt on re-entry, and 
combine with the glass, restoring the sealant composition; 
or (3) the deposits remain on the partʼs surface, melt on re-
entry, and flow onto metal parts.

The root cause of the white deposits on the surface of RCC 
parts was the breakdown of the sealant. This does not dam-
age RCC material.

Non-Destructive Evaluations of Reinforced Carbon-
Carbon Components

Over  the  20  years  of  Space  Shuttle  operations,  RCC  has 
performed  extremely  well  in  the  harsh  environment  it  is 
exposed to during a mission. Within the last several years, 
a few instances of damage to RCC material have resulted 
in a re-examination of the current visual inspection process. 
Concerns  about  potential  oxidation  between  the  silicon 
carbide layer and the substrate and within the substrate has 
resulted in further efforts to develop improved Non-Destruc-
tive Evaluation methods and a better understanding of sub-
surface oxidation. 

Since  1997,  inspections  have  revealed  five  instances  of 
RCC silicon carbide layer loss with exposed substrate. In 
November 1997, Columbia returned from STS-87 with three 
damaged RCC parts with carbon substrate exposed. Panel 
19-right had a 0.04 inch-diameter by 0.035 inch-deep circu-
lar dimple, panel 17-right had a 0.1 inch-wide by 0.2 inch-
long  by  0.025-inch-deep  dimple,  and  the  Orbiter  forward 
External Tank attachment point had a 0.2-inch by 0.15-inch 

by 0.026-inch-deep dimple. In January 2000, after STS-103, 
Discoveryʼs  panel  8-left  was  scrapped  because  of  similar 
damage (see Figure 3.3-5).

In April 2001, after STS-102, Columbiaʼs panel 10-left had a 
0.2-inch by 0.3-inch wide by 0.018-inch-deep dimple in the 
panel corner next to the T-seal. The dimple was repaired and 
the panel flew one more mission, then was scrapped because 
of damage found in the repair.

The  original  design  specifications  required  the 
RCC components to have essentially no impact 
resistance.
Current  inspection  techniques  are  not  adequate 
to assess structural integrity of the RCC compo-
nents. 
After manufacturerʼs acceptance non-destructive 
evaluation, only periodic visual and touch tests 
are conducted.
RCC  components  are  weakened  by  mass  loss 
caused by oxidation within the substrate, which 
accumulates with age. The extent of oxidation is 
not directly measurable, and the resulting mission 
life reduction is developed analytically. 
To  date,  only  two  flown  RCC  panels,  having 
achieved 15 and 19 missions, have been destruc-
tively tested to determine actual loss of strength 
due to oxidation.
Contamination from zinc leaching from a primer 
under the paint topcoat on the launch pad struc-
ture increases the opportunities for localized oxi-
dation.

3.4  IMAGE AND TRANSPORT ANALYSES

At 81.9 seconds after launch of STS-107, a sizable piece of 
foam struck the leading edge of Columbiaʼs left wing. Visual 
evidence established the source of the foam as the left bipod 
ramp area of the External Tank. The widely accepted im-
plausibility of foam causing significant damage to the wing 
leading edge system led the Board to conduct independent 
tests to characterize the impact. While it was impossible to 
determine the precise impact parameters because of uncer-
tainties  about  the  foamʼs  density,  dimensions,  shape,  and 
initial  velocity,  intensive  work  by  the  Board,  NASA,  and 
contractors provided credible ranges for these elements. The 

Board used a combination of tests and analyses to conclude 
that the foam strike observed during the flight of STS-107 
was the direct, physical cause of the accident. 

Image Analysis: Establishing Size, Velocity, Origin, 
and Impact Area 

The  investigation  image  analysis  team  included  members 
from Johnson Space Center Image Analysis, Johnson Space 
Center Engineering, Kennedy Space Center Photo Analysis, 
Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  Photo  Analysis,  Lockheed 
Martin  Management  and  Data  Systems,  the  National  Im-
agery  and  Mapping Agency,  Boeing  Systems  Integration, 
and Langley Research Center. Each member of the image 
analysis team performed independent analyses using tools 
and methods of their own choosing. Representatives of the 
Board participated regularly in the meetings and delibera-
tions of the image analysis team. 

A  35-mm  film  camera,  E212,  which  recorded  the  foam 
strike from 17 miles away, and video camera E208, which 
recorded  it  from  26  miles  away,  provided  the  best  of  the 
available  evidence.  Analysis  of  this  visual  evidence  (see 
Figures 3.4-1 and 3.4-2) along with computer-aided design 
analysis,  refined  the  potential  impact  area  to  less  than  20 
square feet in RCC panels 6 through 9 (see Figure 3.4-3), 
including a portion of the corresponding carrier panels and 
adjacent tiles. The investigation image analysis team found 
no conclusive visual evidence of post-impact debris flowing 
over the top of the wing.

The image analysis team established impact velocities from 
625 to 840 feet per second (about 400 to 600 mph) relative to 
the Orbiter, and foam dimensions from 21 to 27 inches long 
by 12 to 18 inches wide.8 The wide range for these measure-
ments is due primarily to the camerasʼ relatively slow frame 
rate and poor resolution. For example, a 20-inch change in 
the position of the foam near the impact point would change 
the estimated relative impact speed from 675 feet per second 
to 825 feet per second. The visual evidence could not reveal 
the foamʼs shape, but the team was able to describe it as flat 
and relatively thin. The mass and hence the volume of the

tin  Gaithersburg)  and  Figure  3.4-2  (processed  by  the  National 
Imagery and Mapping Agency) are samples of the type of visual 
data used to establish the time of the impact (81.9 seconds), the 
altitude at which it occurred (65,860 feet), and the objectʼs rela-
tive velocity at impact (about 545 mph relative to the Orbiter).

foam was determined from the velocity estimates and their 
ballistic coefficients.

Image analysis determined that the foam was moving almost 
parallel  to  the  Orbiterʼs  fuselage  at  impact,  with  about  a 
five-degree angle upward toward the bottom of the wing and 
slight motion in the outboard direction. If the foam had hit 
the tiles adjacent to the leading edge, the angle of incidence 
would have been about five degrees (the angle of incidence 
is the angle between the relative velocity of the projectile and 
the plane of the impacted surface). Because the wing leading 
edge curves, the angle of incidence increases as the point of 
impact approaches the apex of an RCC panel. Image and 
transport analyses estimated that for impact on RCC panel 
8, the angle of incidence was between 10 and 20 degrees 
(see Figure 3.4-4).9 Because the total force delivered by the 
impact depends on the angle of incidence, a foam strike near 
the apex of an RCC panel could have delivered about twice 
the force as an impact close to the base of the panel. 

Despite the uncertainties and potential errors in the data, the 
Board concurred with conclusions made unanimously by the 
post-flight image analysis team and concludes the informa-
tion available about the foam impact during the mission was 
adequate to determine its effect on both the thermal tiles and 
RCC. Those conclusions made during the mission follow: 

•  The bipod ramp was the source of the foam.
•  Multiple pieces of foam were generated, but there was 

no evidence of more than one strike to the Orbiter. 

•  The center of the foam struck the leading edge structural 
subsystem of the left wing between panels 6 to 9. The 
potential  impact  location  included  the  corresponding 
carrier panels, T-seals, and adjacent tiles. (Based on fur-
ther image analysis performed by the National Imagery 
and  Mapping Agency,  the  transport  analysis  that  fol-
lows, and forensic evidence, the Board concluded that a 
smaller estimated impact area in the immediate vicinity 
of panel 8 was credible.)

•  Estimates of the impact location and velocities rely on 
timing of camera images and foam position measure-
ments.

•  The relative velocity of the foam at impact was 625 to 
840 feet per second. (The Board agreed on a narrower 
speed range based on a transport analysis that follows.)
•  The  trajectory  of  the  foam  at  impact  was  essentially 

parallel to the Orbiterʼs fuselage.

•  The foam was making about 18 revolutions per second 

as it fell.

•  The orientation at impact could not be determined.
•  The foam that struck the wing was 24 (plus or minus 3) 
inches by 15 (plus or minus 3) inches. The foam shape 
could only be described as flat. (A subsequent transport 
analysis estimated a thickness.)

•  Ice was not present on the external surface of the bipod 
ramp  during  the  last  Ice  Team  camera  scan  prior  to 
launch (at approximately T–5 minutes).

•  There was no visual evidence of the presence of other 

materials inside the bipod ramp. 

•  The foam impact generated a cloud of pulverized debris 
with very little component of velocity away from the 
wing.

edge and illustrates the difference the angle of incidence has on 
the effect of the foam strike.

•  In  addition,  the  visual  evidence  showed  two  sizable, 
traceable  post-strike  debris  pieces  with  a  significant 
component of velocity away from the wing.

Although  the  investigation  image  analysis  team  found  no 
evidence  of  post-strike  debris  going  over  the  top  of  the 
wing  before  or  after  impact,  a  colorimetric  analysis  by 
the  National  Imagery  and  Mapping Agency  indicated  the 
potential presence of debris material over the top of the left 
wing immediately following the foam strike. This analysis 
suggests that some of the foam may have struck closer to the 
apex of the wing than what occurred during the impact tests 
described below. 

Imaging Issues

The image analysis was hampered by the lack of high reso-
lution and high speed ground-based cameras. The existing 
camera locations are a legacy of earlier NASA programs, 
and are not optimum for the high-inclination Space Shuttle 
missions to the International Space Station and oftentimes 

THE ORBITER “RAN INTO” THE FOAM
“How could a lightweight piece of foam travel so fast and hit 
the wing at 545 miles per hour?” 

Just prior to separating from the External Tank, the foam was 
traveling with the Shuttle stack at about 1,568 mph (2,300 
feet per second). Visual evidence shows that the foam de-
bris  impacted  the  wing  approximately  0.161  seconds  after 
separating from the External Tank. In that time, the velocity 
of the foam debris slowed from 1,568 mph to about 1,022 
mph (1,500 feet per second). Therefore, the Orbiter hit the 
foam with a relative velocity of about 545 mph (800 feet per 
second). In essence, the foam debris slowed down and the 
Orbiter did not, so the Orbiter ran into the foam. The foam 
slowed down rapidly because such low-density objects have 
low  ballistic  coefficients,  which  means  their  speed  rapidly 
decreases when they lose their means of propulsion.

cameras are not operating or, as in the case of STS-107, out 
of focus. Launch Commit Criteria should include that suf-
ficient cameras are operating to track the Shuttle from liftoff 
to Solid Rocket Booster separation.

Similarly, a developmental vehicle like the Shuttle should be 
equipped with high resolution cameras that monitor potential 
hazard areas. The wing leading edge system, the area around 
the landing gear doors, and other critical Thermal Protection 
System elements need to be imaged to check for damage. 
Debris sources, such as the External Tank, also need to be 
monitored. Such critical images need to be downlinked so 
that potential problems are identified as soon as possible.

Transport Analysis: Establishing Foam Path 
by Computational Fluid Dynamics

Transport analysis is the process of determining the path of 
the foam. To refine the Boardʼs understanding of the foam 
strike,  a  transport  analysis  team,  consisting  of  members 
from  Johnson  Space  Center,  Ames  Research  Center,  and 
Boeing, augmented the image analysis teamʼs research. 

A variety of computer models were used to estimate the vol-
ume of the foam, as well as to refine the estimates of its ve-
locity, its other dimensions, and the impact location. Figure 
3.4-5 lists the velocity and foam size estimates produced dur-
ing the mission and at the conclusion of the investigation.

The results listed in Figure 3.4-5 demonstrate that reason-
ably accurate estimates of the foam size and impact velocity 
were available during the mission. Despite the lack of high-
quality visual evidence, the input data available to assess the 
impact damage during the mission was adequate. 

The input data to the transport analysis consisted of the com-
puted airflow around the Shuttle stack when the foam was 
shed, the estimated aerodynamic characteristics of the foam, 
the image analysis teamʼs trajectory estimates, and the size 
and shape of the bipod ramp.

The transport analysis team screened several of the image 
analysis  teamʼs  location  estimates,  based  on  the  feasible 
aerodynamic  characteristics  of  the  foam  and  the  laws  of 
physics. Optical distortions caused by the atmospheric den-
sity gradients associated with the shock waves off the Or-
biterʼs nose, External Tank, and Solid Rocket Boosters may 
have compromised the image analysis teamʼs three position 
estimates closest to the bipod ramp. In addition, the image 
analysis teamʼs position estimates closest to the wing were 
compromised by the lack of two camera views and the shock 

region ahead of the wing, making triangulation impossible 
and requiring extrapolation. However, the transport analysis 
confirmed that the image analysis teamʼs estimates for the 
central portion of the foam trajectory were well within the 
computed flow field and the estimated range of aerodynamic 
characteristics of the foam.

The team identified a relatively narrow range of foam im-
pact velocities and ballistic coefficients. The ballistic coef-
ficient of an object expresses the relative influence of weight 
and atmospheric drag on it, and is the primary aerodynamic 
characteristic  of  an  object  that  does  not  produce  lift. An 
object  with  a  large  ballistic  coefficient,  such  as  a  cannon 
ball, has a trajectory that can be computed fairly accurately 
without accounting for drag. In contrast, the foam that struck 
the wing had a relatively small ballistic coefficient with a 
large drag force relative to its weight, which explains why 
it slowed down quickly after separating from the External 
Tank.  Just  prior  to  separation,  the  speed  of  the  foam  was 
equal to the speed of the Shuttle, about 1,568 mph (2,300 
feet per second). Because of a large drag force, the foam 
slowed to about 1,022 mph (1,500 feet per second) in about 
0.2  seconds,  and  the  Shuttle  struck  the  foam  at  a  relative 

Figure  3.4-6.  These  are  the  results  of  a  trajectory  analysis  that 
used  a  computational  fluid  dynamics  approach  in  a  program 
called  CART-3D,  a  comprehensive  (six-degree-of-freedom)  com-
puter simulation based on the laws of physics. This analysis used 
the  aerodynamic  and  mass  properties  of  bipod  ramp  foam, 
coupled with the complex flow field during ascent, to determine 
the likely position and velocity histories of the foam.

pendix D.8.)

The undetermined and yet certainly irregular shape of the 
foam introduced substantial uncertainty about its estimated 
aerodynamic characteristics. Appendix D.8 contains an in-
dependent analysis conducted by the Board to confirm that 
the estimated range of ballistic coefficients of the foam in 
Figure 3.4-6 was credible, given the foam dimension results 
from the image analyses and the expected range of the foam 
density. Based on the results in Figure 3.4-7, the physical 
dimensions  of  the  bipod  ramp,  and  the  sizes  and  shapes 
of  the  available  barrels  for  the  compressed-gas  gun  used 
in the impact test program described later in this chapter, 
the Board and the NASA Accident Investigation Team de-
cided that a foam projectile 19 inches by 11.5 inches by 5.5 
inches, weighing 1.67 pounds, and with a weight density of 
2.4 pounds per cubic foot, would best represent the piece of 
foam that separated from the External Tank bipod ramp and 
was hit by the Orbiterʼs left wing. See Section 3.8 for a full 
discussion of the foam impact testing.

Immediately after the accident, Air Force Space Command 
began an in-depth review of its Space Surveillance Network 
data  to  determine  if  there  were  any  detectable  anomalies 
during the STS-107 mission. A review of the data resulted in 
no information regarding damage to the Orbiter. However, 
Air Force processing of Space Surveillance Network data 
yielded 3,180 separate radar or optical observations of the 
Orbiter  from  radar  sites  at  Eglin,  Beale,  and  Kirtland Air 
Force  Bases,  Cape  Cod Air  Force  Station,  the Air  Force 
Space  Commandʼs  Maui  Space  Surveillance  System  in 
Hawaii,  and  the  Navy  Space  Surveillance  System.  These 
observations, examined after the accident, showed a small 
object in orbit with Columbia. In accordance with the In-
ternational Designator system, the object was named 2003-

Events around the estimated separation time of the object

data  indicates  that  no  unusual  crew  activities,  telemetry 
data, or accelerations in Orbiter or payload can account for 
the  release  of  an  object.  No  external  mechanical  systems 
were active, nor were any translational (forward, backward, 
or sideways, as opposed to rotational) maneuvers attempted 
in this period. However, two attitude maneuvers were made: 
a 48-degree yaw maneuver to a left-wing-forward and pay-
load-bay-to-Earth attitude from 9:42 to 9:46 a.m. EST), and 

ON-ORBIT COLLISION AVOIDANCE
The Space Control Center, operated by the 21st Space Wingʼs 
1st Space Control Squadron (a unit of Air Force Space Com-
mand),  maintains  an  orbital  data  catalog  on  some  9,000 
Earth-orbiting objects, from active satellites to space debris, 
some of which may be as small as four inches. The Space 
Control Center ensures that no known orbiting objects will 
transit an Orbiter “safety zone” measuring 6 miles deep by 
25 miles wide and long (Figure A) during a Shuttle mission 
by projecting the Orbiterʼs flight path for the next 72 hours 
(Figure B) and comparing it to the flight paths of all known 
orbiting  or  re-entering  objects,  which  generally  travel  at 
17,500 miles per hour. Whenever possible, the Orbiter moves 
tail-first  while  on  orbit  to  minimize  the  chances  of  orbital 
debris or micrometeoroids impacting the cabin windscreen or 
the Orbiterʼs wing leading edge.

If an object is determined to be 
within  36-72  hours  of  collid-
ing with the Orbiter, the Space 
Control Center notifies NASA, 
and the agency then determines 
a maneuver to avoid a collision. 
There were no close approach-
es to Columbia detected during

a maneuver back to the bay-to-Earth, tail-forward attitude 
from 10:17 to 10:21 a.m. It is possible that this maneuver 
imparted the initial departure velocity to the object.

Although  various  Space  Surveillance  Network  radars 
tracked  the  object,  the  only  reliable  physical  information 
includes  the  objectʼs  ballistic  coefficient  in  kilograms  per 
square  meter  and  its  radar  cross-section  in  decibels  per 
square  meter. An  objectʼs  radar  cross-section  relates  how 
much  radar  energy  the  object  scatters.  Since  radar  cross-
section depends on the objectʼs material properties, shape, 
and orientation relative to the radar, the Space Surveillance 
Network could not independently estimate the objectʼs size 
or  shape.  By  radar  observation,  the  objectʼs  Ultra-High 
Frequency  (UHF)  radar  cross-section  varied  between  0.0 
and  minus  18.0  decibels  per  square  meter  (plus  or  minus 
1.3 decibels), and its ballistic coefficient was known to be 
0.1 kilogram per meter squared (plus or minus 15 percent). 
These two quantities were used to test and ultimately elimi-
nate various objects.

In the Advanced Compact Range at the Air Force Research 
Laboratory  in  Dayton,  Ohio,  analysts  tested  31  materials 
from  the  Orbiterʼs  exterior  and  payload  bay.  Additional 
supercomputer radar cross-section predictions were made 
for  Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  T-seals.  After  exhaustive 
radar cross-section analysis and testing, coupled with bal-
listic analysis of the objectʼs orbital decay, only a fragment 
of  RCC  panel  would  match  the  UHF  radar  cross-section 
and  ballistic  coefficients  observed  by  the  Space  Surveil-
lance network. Such an RCC panel fragment must be ap-
proximately 140 square inches or greater in area to meet the 
observed  radar  cross-section  characteristics.  Figure  3.5-1 
shows RCC panel fragments from Columbiaʼs right wing 
that represent those meeting the observed characteristics of 
object 2003-003B.10

Note that the Southwest Research Institute foam impact test 
on panel 8 (see Section 3.8) created RCC fragments that fell 
into the wing cavity. These pieces are consistent in size with 
the RCC panel fragments that exhibited the required physi-
cal characteristics consistent with the Flight Day 2 object.

3.6  DE-ORBIT/RE-ENTRY

As Columbia re-entered Earthʼs atmosphere, sensors in the 
Orbiter relayed streams of data both to entry controllers on 
the  ground  at  Johnson  Space  Center  and  to  the  Modular 
Auxiliary Data System recorder, which survived the breakup 
of the Orbiter and was recovered by ground search teams. 
This  data  –  temperatures,  pressures,  and  stresses  –  came 
from sensors located throughout the Orbiter. Entry control-
lers were unaware of any problems with re-entry until telem-
etry data indicated errant readings. During the investigation 
data from these two sources was used to make aerodynamic, 
aerothermal, and mechanical reconstructions of re-entry that 
showed how these stresses affected the Orbiter.

The re-entry analysis and testing focused on eight areas:

1.  Analysis  of  the  Modular Auxiliary  Data  System  re-
corder information and the pattern of wire runs and 
sensor failures throughout the Orbiter.

2.  Physical and chemical analysis of the recovered de-
bris to determine where the breach in the RCC panels 
likely occurred.

3.  Analysis of videos and photography provided by the 

general public.

4.  Abnormal heating on the outside of the Orbiter body. 
Sensors showed lower heating and then higher heating 
than is usually seen on the left Orbital Maneuvering 
System pod and the left side of the fuselage. 

5.  Early heating inside the wing leading edge. Initially, 
heating occurred inside the left wing RCC panels be-
fore the wing leading edge spar was breached.

6.  Later heating inside the left wing structure. This analy-
sis focused on the inside of the left wing after the wing 
leading edge spar had been breached.

7.  Early changes in aerodynamic performance. The Or-
biter began reacting to increasing left yaw and left roll, 
consistent with developing drag and loss of lift on the 
left wing.

8.  Later  changes  in  aerodynamic  performance. Almost 
600 seconds after Entry Interface, the left-rolling ten-
dency of the Orbiter changes to a right roll, indicating 
an increase in lift on the left wing. The left yaw also 
increased, showing increasing drag on the left wing.

For  a  complete  compilation  of  all  re-entry  data,  see  the 

CAIB/NAIT Working Scenario (Appendix D.7) and the Re-
entry Timeline (Appendix D.9). The extensive aerothermal 
calculations and wind tunnel tests performed to investigate 
the  observed  re-entry  phenomenon  are  documented  in 
NASA report NSTS-37398.

Re-Entry Environment

In the demanding environment of re-entry, the Orbiter must 
withstand the high temperatures generated by its movement 
through  the  increasingly  dense  atmosphere  as  it  deceler-
ates from orbital speeds to land safely. At these velocities, 
shock waves form at the nose and along the leading edges 
of  the  wing,  intersecting  near  RCC  panel  9.  The  interac-
tion  between  these  two  shock  waves  generates  extremely 
high temperatures, especially around RCC panel 9, which 
experiences the highest surface temperatures of all the RCC 
panels. The flow behind these shock waves is at such a high 
temperature  that  air  molecules  are  torn  apart,  or  “dissoci-
ated.” The air immediately around the leading edge surface 
can reach 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit; however, the boundary 
layer shields the Orbiter so that the actual temperature is only 
approximately 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit at the leading edge. 
The RCC panels and internal insulation protect the alumi-
num wing leading edge spar. A breach in one of the leading-
edge RCC panels would expose the internal wing structure 
to temperatures well above 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

In contrast to the aerothermal environment, the aerodynamic 
environment during Columbiaʼs re-entry was relatively be-
nign, especially early in re-entry. The re-entry dynamic pres-
sure ranged from zero at Entry Interface to 80 pounds per 
square foot when the Orbiter went out of control, compared 
with a dynamic pressure during launch and ascent of nearly 
700  pounds  per  square  foot.  However,  the  aerodynamic 
forces were increasing quickly during the final minutes of 
Columbiaʼs flight, and played an important role in the loss 
of control.

Orbiter Sensors

The  Operational  Flight  Instrumentation  monitors  physical 
sensors  and  logic  signals  that  report  the  status  of  various 
Orbiter  functions.  These  sensor  readings  and  signals  are 
telemetered via a 128 kilobit-per-second data stream to the 
Mission Control Center, where engineers ascertain the real-
time health of key Orbiter systems. An extensive review of 
this data has been key to understanding what happened to 
STS-107 during ascent, orbit, and re-entry.

The  Modular  Auxiliary  Data  System  is  a  supplemental 
instrumentation  system  that  gathers  Orbiter  data  for  pro-
cessing  after  the  mission  is  completed.  Inputs  are  almost 
exclusively physical sensor readings of temperatures, pres-
sures, mechanical strains, accelerations, and vibrations. The 
Modular Auxiliary  Data  System  usually  records  only  the 
missionʼs first and last two hours (see Figure 3.6-1).

The  Orbiter  Experiment  instrumentation  is  an  expanded 
suite of sensors for the Modular Auxiliary Data System that 
was  installed  on  Columbia  for  engineering  development 
purposes. Because Columbia was the first Orbiter launched,

engineering teams needed a means to gather more detailed 
flight  data  to  validate  their  calculations  of  conditions  the 
vehicle would experience during critical flight phases. The 
instrumentation remained on Columbia as a legacy of the 
development process, and was still providing valuable flight 
data from ascent, de-orbit, and re-entry for ongoing flight 
analysis and vehicle engineering. Nearly all of Columbiaʼs 
sensors were specified to have only a 10-year shelf life, and 
in some cases an even shorter service life. 

At 22 years old, the majority of the Orbiter Experiment in-
strumentation had been in service twice as long as its speci-
fied service life, and in fact, many sensors were already fail-
ing. Engineers planned to stop collecting and analyzing data 
once most of the sensors had failed, so failed sensors and 
wiring were not repaired. For instance, of the 181 sensors in 
Columbiaʼs wings, 55 had already failed or were producing 
questionable readings before STS-107 was launched. 

Re-Entry Timeline

Times in the following section are noted in seconds elapsed 
from the time Columbia crossed Entry Interface (EI) over 
the Pacific Ocean at 8:44:09 a.m. EST. Columbiaʼs destruc-
tion occurred in the period from Entry Interface at 400,000 
feet (EI+000) to about 200,000 feet (EI+970) over Texas. 
The  Modular  Auxiliary  Data  System  recorded  the  first 
indications of problems at EI plus 270 seconds (EI+270). 
Because data from this system is retained onboard, Mission 
Control did not notice any troubling indications from telem-
etry data until 8:54:24 a.m. (EI+613), some 10 minutes after 
Entry Interface.

Figure  3.6-4.  This  temperature  thermocouple  (Sensor  2)  was 
mounted on the outside of the wing leading edge spar behind the 
insulation that protects the spar from radiated heat from the RCC 
panels. It clearly showed an off-nominal trend early in the re-entry 
sequence  and  began  to  show  an  increase  in  temperature  much 
earlier than the temperature sensor behind the spar.

Sensor 1 provided the first anomalous reading (see Figure 
3.6-3). From EI+270 to EI+360, the strain is higher than that 
on previous Columbia flights. At EI+450, the strain reverses, 
and then peaks again in a negative direction at EI+475. The 
strain then drops slightly, and remains constant and negative 
until EI+495, when the sensor pattern becomes unreliable, 
probably due to a propagating soft short, or “burn-through” 
of the insulation between cable conductors caused by heating 
or combustion. This strain likely indicates significant damage 
to the aluminum honeycomb spar. In particular, strain rever-
sals,  which  are  unusual,  likely  mean  there  was  significant 
high-temperature damage to the spar during this time. 

At EI+290, 20 seconds after Sensor 1 gave its first anoma-
lous reading, Sensor 2, the only sensor in the front of the

left  wing  leading  edge  spar,  recorded  the  beginning  of  a 
gradual and abnormal rise in temperature from an expected 
30 degrees Fahrenheit to 65 degrees at EI+493, when it then 
dropped to “off-scale low,” a reading that drops off the scale 
at the low end of the sensorʼs range (see Figure 3.6-4). Sen-
sor 2, one of the first to fail, did so abruptly. It had indicated 
only a mild warming of the RCC attachment clevis before 
the signal was lost.

A series of thermal analyses were performed for different 
sized holes in RCC panel 8 to compute the time required to 
heat Sensor 2 to the temperature recorded by the Modular 
Auxiliary Data System. To heat the clevis, various insula-
tors  would  have  to  be  bypassed  with  a  small  amount  of 
leakage, or “sneak flow.” Figure 3.6-5 shows the results of 
these calculations for, as an example, a 10-inch hole, and 
demonstrates that with sneak flow around the insulation, the 
temperature profile of the clevis sensor was closely matched 
by the engineering calculations. This is consistent with the 
same sneak flow required to match a similar but abnormal 
ascent  temperature  rise  of  the  same  sensor,  which  further 
supports the premise that the breach in the leading edge of 
the wing occurred during ascent. While the exact size of the 
breach will never be known, and may have been smaller or 
larger than 10 inches, these analyses do provide a plausible 
explanation for the observed rises in temperature sensor data 
during re-entry.

Investigators  initially  theorized  that  the  foam  might  have 
broken  a  T-seal  and  allowed  superheated  air  to  enter  the 
wing  between  the  RCC  panels.  However,  the  amount  of 
T-seal  debris  from  this  area  and  subsequent  aerothermal 
analysis showing this type of breach did not match the ob-
served damage to the wing, led investigators to eliminate a 
missing T-seal as the source of the breach.

Although abnormal, the re-entry temperature rise was slow 
and small compared to what would be expected if Sensor 2 
were exposed to a blast of superheated air from an assumed 
breach in the RCC panels. The slow temperature rise is at-

located in a thermal tile on the lower surface of the left wing, its 
temperatures are much higher than those for the other sensors.

tributed to the presence of a relatively modest breach in the 
RCC, the thick insulation that surrounds the sensor, and the 
distance from the site of the breach in RCC panel 8 to the 
clevis sensor.

The  readings  of  Sensor  3,  which  was  in  a  thermal  tile, 
began rising abnormally high and somewhat erratically as 
early as EI+370, with several brief spikes to 2,500 degrees 
Fahrenheit, significantly higher than the 2,000-degree peak 
temperature on a normal re-entry (Figure 3.6-6). At EI+496, 
this reading became unreliable, indicating a failure of the 
wire or the sensor. Because this thermocouple was on the 
wing  lower  surface,  directly  behind  the  junction  of  RCC 
panel 9 and 10, the high temperatures it initially recorded 
were almost certainly a result of air jetting through the dam-
aged area of RCC panel 8, or of the normal airflow being 
disturbed by the damage. Note that Sensor 3 provided an 
external temperature measurement, while Sensors 2 and 4 
provided internal temperature measurements. 

Sensor 4 also recorded a rise in temperature that ended in an 
abrupt fall to off-scale low. Figure 3.6-7 shows that an ab-
normal temperature rise began at EI+425 and abruptly fell at 
EI+525. Unlike Sensor 2, this temperature rise was extreme, 
from an expected 20 degrees Fahrenheit at EI+425 to 40 de-
grees at EI+485, and then rising much faster to 120 degrees 
at EI+515, then to an off-scale high (a reading that climbs 
off the scale at the high end of the range) of 450 degrees at 
EI+522. The failure pattern of this sensor likely indicates 
destruction by extreme heat. 

The timing of the failures of these four sensors and the path 
of their cable routing enables a determination of both the 
timing and location of the breach of the leading edge spar, 
and indirectly, the breach of the RCC panels. All the cables 
from these sensors, and many others, were routed into wir-
ing harnesses that ran forward along the back side of the 
leading edge spar up to a cross spar (see Figure 3.6-8), where 
they passed through the service opening in the cross spar 
and then ran in front of the left wheel well before reaching 
interconnect panel 65P, where they entered the fuselage. All 
sensors with wiring in this set of harnesses failed between 
EI+487 to EI+497, except Sensor 4, which survived until 
EI+522. The diversity of sensor types (temperature, pres-
sure, and strains) and their locations in the left wing indi-
cates  that  they  failed  because  their  wiring  was  destroyed 
at  spar  burn-through,  as  opposed  to  destruction  of  each 
individual sensor by direct heating.

Examination of wiring installation closeout photographs (pic-
tures that document the state of the area that are normally taken 
just before access is closed) and engineering drawings show 
five main wiring harness bundles running forward along the 
spar, labeled top to bottom as A through E (see Figure 3.6-8). 
The top four, A through D, are spaced 3 inches apart, while 
the fifth, E, is 6 inches beneath them. The separation between 
bundle E and the other four is consistent with the later fail-
ure time of Sensor 4 by 25 to 29 seconds, and indicates that 
the breach was in the upper two-thirds of the spar, causing 
all but one of the cables in this area to fail between EI+487 
to EI+497. The breach then expanded vertically, toward the 
underside of the wing, causing Sensor 4 to fail 25 seconds

Figure  3.6-7.  Sensor  4  also  began  reading  significantly  higher 
than previous flights before it fell off-scale low. The relatively late 
reaction  of  this  sensor  compared  to  Sensor  2,  clearly  indicated 
that superheated air started on the outside of the wing leading 
edge spar and then moved into the mid-wing after the spar was 
burned through. Note that immediately before the sensor (or the 
wire)  fails,  the  temperature  is  at  450  degrees  Fahrenheit  and 
climbing rapidly. It was the only temperature sensor that showed 
this pattern.

later. Because the distance between bundle A and bundle E 
is 9 inches, the failure of all these wires indicates that the 
breach in the wing leading edge spar was at least 9 inches 
from top to bottom by EI+522 seconds.

began seeing off-nominal sensor indications.

Also  directly  behind  RCC  panel  8  were  pressure  sensors 
V07P8010A  (Sensor  5),  on  the  upper  interior  surface  of 
the wing, and V07P8058A (Sensor 6), on the lower interior 
surface  of  the  wing.  Sensor  5  failed  abruptly  at  EI+497. 
Sensor 6, which was slightly more protected, began falling 
at EI+495, and failed completely at EI+505. Closeout pho-
tographs show that the wiring from Sensor 5 travels down 
from the top of the wing to join the uppermost harness, A, 
which then travels along the leading edge spar. Similarly, 
wiring from Sensor 6 travels up from the bottom of the wing, 
joins harness A, and continues along the spar. It appears that 
Sensor 5ʼs wiring, on the upper wing surface, was damaged 
at EI+497, right after Sensor 1 failed. Noting the times of the 
sensor failures, and the locations of Sensors 5 and 6 forward 
of  Sensors  1  through  4,  spar  burn-through  must  have  oc-
curred near where these wires came together. 

Two of the 45 left wing strain gauges also recorded an anom-
aly around EI+500 to EI+580, but their readings were not 
erratic or off-scale until late in the re-entry, at EI+930. Strain 
gauge V12G9048A was far forward on a cross spar in the 
front of the wheel well on the lower spar cap, and strain gauge 
V12G9049A was on the upper spar cap. Their responses ap-
pear to be the actual strain at that location until their failure 
at EI+935. The exposed wiring for most of the left wing sen-
sors runs along the front of the spar that crosses in front of 
the left wheel well. The very late failure times of these two 
sensors indicate that the damage did not spread into the wing 
cavity forward of the wheel well until at least EI+935, which 
implies that the breach was aft of the cross spar. Because the 
cross spar attaches to the transition spar behind RCC panel 
6, the breach must have been aft (outboard) of panel 6. The 
superheated air likely burned through the outboard wall of 
the wheel well, rather than snaking forward and then back 
through the vent at the front of the wheel well. Had the gases 
flowed through the access opening in the cross spar and then 
through the vent into the wheel well, it is unlikely that the 
lower strain gauge wiring would have survived.

Figure  3.6-9.  Orbital  Maneuvering  System  (OMS)  pod  heating 
was initially significantly lower than that seen on previous Colum-
bia missions. As wing leading edge damage later increased, the 
OMS pod heating increased dramatically. Debris recovered from 
this area of the OMS pod showed substantial pre-breakup heat 
damage and imbedded drops of once-molten metal from the wing 
leading edge in the OMS pod thermal tiles.

Finally, the rapid rise in Sensor 4 at EI+425, before the other 
sensors began to fail, indicates that high temperatures were 
responsible. Comparisons of sensors on the outside of the 
wing leading edge spar, those inside of the spar, and those in 
the wing and left wheel well indicate that abnormal heating 
first began on the outside of the spar behind the RCC panels 
and worked through the spar. Since the aluminum spar must 
have burned through before any cable harnesses attached to 
it failed, the breach through the wing leading edge spar must 
have occurred at or before EI+487.

Other abnormalities also occurred during re-entry. Early in 
re-entry, the heating normally seen on the left Orbital Ma-
neuvering System pod was much lower than usual for this 
point  in  the  flight  (see  Figure  3.6-9). Wind  tunnel  testing 
demonstrated  that  airflow  into  a  breach  in  an  RCC  panel 
would  then  escape  through  the  wing  leading  edge  vents 
behind the upper part of the panel and interrupt the weak 
aerodynamic flow field on top of the wing. During re-entry, 
air normally flows into these vents to equalize air pressure 
across  the  RCC  panels. The  interruption  in  the  flow  field 
behind the wing caused a displacement of the vortices that 
normally hit the leading edge of the left pod, and resulted 
in a slowing of pod heating. Heating of the side fuselage 
slowed, which wind tunnel testing also predicted. 

To match this scenario, investigators had to postulate dam-
age  to  the  tiles  on  the  upper  carrier  panel  9,  in  order  to 
allow  sufficient  mass  flow  through  the  vent  to  cause  the 
observed  decrease  in  sidewall  heating.  No  upper  carrier 
panels were found from panels 9, 10, and 11, which supports 
this hypothesis. Although this can account for the abnormal 
temperatures on the body of the Orbiter and at the Orbital 
Maneuvering System pod, flight data and wind tunnel tests 
confirmed that this venting was not strong enough to alter 
the aerodynamic force on the Orbiter, and the aerodynamic 
analysis of mission data showed no change in Orbiter flight 
control parameters during this time.

During re-entry, a change was noted in the rate of the tem-
perature rise around the RCC chin panel clevis temperature 
sensor and two water supply nozzles on the left side of the 
fuselage, just aft of the main bulkhead that divides the crew 
cabin from the payload bay. Because these sensors were well 
forward of the damage in the left wing leading edge, it is still 
unclear how their indications fit into the failure scenario. 

Sensor Loss and the Onset of Unusual Aerodynamic 
Effects (EI+500 through EI+611)

Fourteen seconds after the loss of the first sensor wire on the 
wing leading edge spar at EI+487, a sensor wire in a bundle 
of some 150 wires that ran along the upper outside corner 
of the left wheel well showed a burn-through. In the next 50 
seconds, more than 70 percent of the sensor wires in three 
cables in this area also burned through (see Figure 3.6-10). 
Investigators plotted the wiring run for every left-wing sen-
sor,  looking  for  a  relationship  between  their  location  and 
time of failure. 

Only  two  sensor  wires  of  169  remained  intact  when  the 
Modular Auxiliary Data System recorder stopped, indicat-

Figure 3.6-10. This chart shows how rapidly the wire bundles in the left wing were destroyed. Over 70 percent of the sensor wires in the 
wiring bundles burned through in under a minute. The black diamonds show the times of significant timeline sensor events.

ing that the burn-throughs had to occur in an area that nearly 
every wire ran through. To sustain this type of damage, the 
wires had to be close enough to the breach for the gas plume 
to hit them. Arc jet testing (in a wind tunnel with an electri-
cal  arc  that  provides  up  to  a  2,800-degree  Fahrenheit  air-
flow) on a simulated wing leading edge spar and simulated 
wire bundles showed how the leading edge spar would burn 
through in a few seconds. It also showed that wire bundles 
would  burn  through  in  a  timeframe  consistent  with  those 
seen in the Modular Auxiliary Data System information and 
the telemetered data.

Later  computational  fluid  dynamics  analysis  of  the  mid-
wing  area  behind  the  spar  showed  that  superheated  air 
flowing into a breached RCC panel 8 and then interacting 
with the internal structure behind the RCC cavity (RCC ribs 
and spar insulation) would have continued through the wing 
leading edge spar as a jet, and would have easily allowed 
superheated air to traverse the 56.5 inches from the spar to 
the outside of the wheel well and destroy the cables (Figure 
3.6-11). Controllers on the ground saw these first anomalies 
in the telemetry data at EI+613, when four hydraulic sensor 
cables that ran from the aft part of the left wing through the 
wiring bundles outside the wheel well failed.

Aerodynamic roll and yaw forces began to differ from those 
on previous flights at about EI+500 (see Figure 3.6-12). In-
vestigators used flight data to reconstruct the aerodynamic 
forces acting on the Orbiter. This reconstructed data was then 
compared to forces seen on other similar flights of Columbia

Time (min:sec)

Figure 3.6-12. At approximately EI+500 seconds, the aerodynamic roll and yaw forces began to diverge from those observed on previous 
flights. The blue line shows the Orbiterʼs tendency to yaw while the red line shows its tendency to roll. Nominal values would parallel the 
solid black line. Above the black line, the direction of the force is to the right, while below the black line, the force is to the left.

and to the forces predicted for STS-107. In the early phase 
of fight, these abnormal aerodynamic forces indicated that 
Columbiaʼs flight control system was reacting to a change 
in the external shape of the wing, which was caused by pro-
gressive RCC damage that caused a continuing decrease in 
lift and a continuing increase in drag on the left wing.

Between EI+530 and EI+562, four sensors on the left in-
board elevon failed. These sensor readings were part of the 
data telemetered to the ground. Noting the system failures, 
the  Maintenance,  Mechanical,  and  Crew  Systems  officer 
notified the Flight Director of the failures. (See sidebar in 
Chapter  2  for  a  complete  version  of  the  Mission  Control 
Center conversation about this data.)

At EI+555, Columbia crossed the California coast. People 
on the ground now saw the damage developing on the Or-
biter in the form of debris being shed, and documented this 
with video cameras. In the next 15 seconds, temperatures 
on the fuselage sidewall and the left Orbital Maneuvering 
System pod began to rise. Hypersonic wind tunnel tests indi-
cated that the increased heating on the Orbital Maneuvering 
System pod and the roll and yaw changes were caused by 

substantial leading edge damage around RCC panel 9. Data 
on Orbiter temperature distribution as well as aerodynamic 
forces  for  various  damage  scenarios  were  obtained  from 
wind tunnel testing.

Figure 3.6-13 shows the comparison of surface temperature 
distribution with an undamaged Orbiter and one with an en-
tire panel 9 removed. With panel 9 removed, a strong vortex 
flow structure is positioned to increase the temperature on 
the leading edge of the Orbital Maneuvering System pod. 
The aim is not to demonstrate that all of panel 9 was miss-
ing at this point, but rather to indicate that major damage to 
panels near panel 9 can shift the strong vortex flow pattern 
and change the Orbiterʼs temperature distribution to match 
the Modular Auxiliary Data System information. Wind tun-
nel tests also demonstrated that increasing damage to lead-
ing edge RCC panels would result in increasing drag and 
decreasing lift on the left wing.

Recovered debris showed that Inconel 718, which is only 
found in wing leading edge spanner beams and attachment 
fittings, was deposited on the left Orbital Maneuvering Sys-
tem pod, verifying that airflow through the breach and out

of the upper slot carried molten wing leading edge material 
back to the pod. Temperatures far exceeded those seen on 
previous re-entries and further confirmed that the wing lead-
ing-edge damage was increasing. 

By  this  time,  superheated  air  had  been  entering  the  wing 
since EI+487, and significant internal damage had probably 
occurred. The  major  internal  support  structure  in  the  mid-
wing consists of aluminum trusses with a melting point of 
1,200 degrees Fahrenheit. Because the ingested air may have 
been as hot as 8,000 degrees near the breach, it is likely that 
the internal support structure that maintains the shape of the 
wing was severely compromised. 

As the Orbiter flew east, people on the ground continued to 
record the major shedding of debris. Investigators later scru-
tinized  these  videos  to  compare  Columbiaʼs  re-entry  with 
recordings of other re-entries and to identify the debris. The 
video analysis was also used to determine additional search 
areas on the ground and to estimate the size of various pieces 
of debris as they fell from the Orbiter.

Temperatures  in  the  wheel  well  began  to  rise  rapidly  at 
EI+601,  which  indicated  that  the  superheated  air  coming 
through the wing leading edge spar had breached the wheel 
well wall. At the same time, observers on the ground noted 
additional significant shedding of debris. Analysis of one of 
these “debris events” showed that the photographed object 
could have weighed nearly 190 pounds, which would have 
significantly altered Columbiaʼs physical condition.

At EI+602, the tendency of the Orbiter to roll to the left in 
response to a loss of lift on the left wing transitioned to a 
right-rolling tendency, now in response to increased lift on 
the left wing. Observers on the ground noted additional sig-
nificant shedding of debris in the next 30 seconds. Left yaw 
continued to increase, consistent with increasing drag on the 
left wing. Further damage to the RCC panels explains the 
increased drag on the left wing, but it does not explain the 
sudden increase in lift, which can be explained only by some 
other type of wing damage. 

Investigators  ran  multiple  analyses  and  wind  tunnel  tests 
to understand this significant aerodynamic event. Analysis 
showed  that  by  EI+850,  the  temperatures  inside  the  wing

THE KIRTLAND IMAGE
As Columbia passed over Albuquerque, New Mexico, during 
re-entry (around EI+795), scientists at the Air Force Starfire 
Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base acquired images of 
the Orbiter. This imaging had not been officially assigned, 
and the photograph was taken using commercial equipment 
located at the site, not with the advanced Starfire adaptive-
optics telescope.

The image shows an unusual condition on the left wing, a 
leading-edge disturbance that might indicate damage. Sev-
eral  analysts  concluded  that  the  distortion  evident  in  the 
image likely came from the modification and interaction of 
shock waves due to the damaged leading edge. The overall 
appearance of the leading-edge damage at this point on the 
trajectory is consistent with the scenario.

were high enough to substantially damage the wing skins, 
wing leading edge spar, and the wheel well wall, and melt 
the wingʼs support struts. Once structural support was lost, 
the wing likely deformed, effectively changing shape and re-
sulting in increased lift and a corresponding increase in drag 
on the left wing. The increased drag on the left wing further 
increased the Orbiterʼs tendency to yaw left. 

Loss of Vehicle Control (EI+612 through EI+970)

A rise in hydraulic line temperatures inside the left wheel 
well indicated that superheated air had penetrated the wheel 
well wall by EI+727. This temperature rise, telemetered to 
Mission Control, was noted by the Maintenance, Mechani-
cal,  and  Crew  Systems  officer.  The  Orbiter  initiated  and 
completed its  roll  reversal  by  EI+766  and  was  positioned 
left-wing-down for this portion of re-entry. The Guidance 
and Flight Control Systems performed normally, although 
the aero-control surfaces (aileron trim) continued to counter-
act the additional drag and lift from the left wing.

At EI+790, two left main gear outboard tire pressure sen-
sors began trending slightly upward, followed very shortly 
by going off-scale low, which indicated extreme heating of 
both the left inboard and outboard tires. The tires, with their 
large mass, would require substantial heating to produce the 
sensorsʼ slight temperature rise. Another sharp change in the 
rolling tendency of the Orbiter occurred at EI+834, along

from areas in front of the wheel well (the red boxes on each wing) were similar, but there were dramatic differences in the amount of debris

with additional shedding of debris. In an attempt to maintain 
attitude control, the Orbiter responded with a sharp change 
in aileron trim, which indicated there was another significant 
change to the left wing configuration, likely due to wing de-
formation. By EI+887, all left main gear inboard and out-
board  tire  pressure  and  wheel  temperature  measurements 
were lost, indicating burning wires and a rapid progression 
of damage in the wheel well. 

At  EI+897,  the  left  main  landing  gear  downlock  position 
indicator reported that the gear was now down and locked. 
At the same time, a sensor indicated the landing gear door 
was  still  closed,  while  another  sensor  indicated  that  the 
main landing gear was still locked in the up position. Wire 
burn-through testing showed that a burn-induced short in the 
downlock sensor wiring could produce these same contra-
dictions in gear status indication. Several measurements on 
the strut produced valid data until the final loss of telemetry 
data. This suggests that the gear-down-and locked indica-
tion was the result of a wire burn-through, not a result of 
the landing gear actually deploying. All four corresponding 
proximity switch sensors for the right main landing gear re-
mained normal throughout re-entry until telemetry was lost. 

Figure 3.7-2. Each RCC panel has a U-shaped slot (see arrow) in 
the back of the panel. Once superheated air entered the breach 
in RCC panel 8, some of that superheated air went through this 
slot  and  caused  substantial  damage  to  the  Thermal  Protection 
System tiles behind this area.

Post-accident analysis of flight data that was generated af-
ter  telemetry  information  was  lost  showed  another  abrupt 
change  in  the  Orbiterʼs  aerodynamics  caused  by  a  contin-
ued  progression  of  left  wing  damage  at  EI+917. The  data 
showed a significant increase in positive roll and negative 
yaw,  again  indicating  another  increase  in  drag  on  and  lift 
from the damaged left wing. Columbiaʼs flight control sys-
tem attempted to compensate for this increased left yaw by 
firing all four right yaw jets. Even with all thrusters firing, 
combined with a maximum rate of change of aileron trim, the 
flight control system was unable to control the left yaw, and 
control of the Orbiter was lost at EI+970 seconds. Mission 
Control lost all telemetry data from the Orbiter at EI+923 
(8:59:32 a.m.). Civilian and military video cameras on the 
ground documented the final breakup. The Modular Auxil-
iary Data System stopped recording at EI+970 seconds.

The Modular Auxiliary Data System instrumen-
tation and sensor suite on each Orbiter should be 
maintained and updated to include current sensor 
and data acquisition technologies.
The  Modular Auxiliary  Data  System  should  be 
redesigned  to  include  engineering  performance 
and  vehicle  health  information,  and  have  the 
ability to be reconfigured during flight in order to 
allow certain data to be recorded, telemetered, or 
both, as needs change.

3.7  DEBRIS ANALYSIS

The Board performed a detailed and exhaustive investigation 
of the debris that was recovered. While sensor data from the 
Orbiter pointed to early problems on the left wing, it could 
only isolate the breach to the general area of the left wing 
RCC panels. Forensics analysis independently determined 
that RCC panel 8 was the most likely site of the breach, and 
this was subsequently corroborated by other analyses. (See 
Appendix D.11.)

Pre-Breakup and
Post-Breakup Damage Determination

Differentiating between pre-breakup and post-breakup dam-
age proved a challenge. When Columbiaʼs main body break-

up occurred, the Orbiter was at an altitude of about 200,000 
feet and traveling at Mach 19, well within the peak-heating 
region calculated for its re-entry profile. Consequently, as 
individual  pieces  of  the  Orbiter  were  exposed  to  the  at-
mosphere  at  breakup,  they  experienced  temperatures  high 
enough to damage them. If a part had been damaged by heat 
prior to breakup, high post-breakup temperatures could eas-
ily conceal the pre-breakup evidence. In some cases, there 
was  no  clear  way  to  determine  what  happened  when.  In 
other cases, heat erosion occurred over fracture surfaces, in-
dicating the piece had first broken and had then experienced 
high  temperatures.  Investigators  concluded  that  pre-  and 
post-breakup damage had to be determined on a part-by-part 
basis; it was impossible to make broad generalizations based 
on the gross physical evidence.

Amount of Right Wing Debris
versus Left Wing Debris

Detailed  analysis  of  the  debris  revealed  unique  features 
and convincing evidence that the damage to the left wing 
differed significantly from damage to the right, and that sig-
nificant differences existed in pieces from various areas of 
the left wing. While a substantial amount of upper and lower 
right wing structure was recovered, comparatively little of 
the upper and lower left wing structure was recovered (see 
Figure 3.7-1). 

The difference in recovered debris from the Orbiterʼs wings 
clearly indicates that after the breakup, most of the left wing 
succumbed to both high heat and aerodynamic forces, while 
the right wing succumbed to aerodynamic forces only. Be-
cause the left wing was already compromised, it was the first 
area of the Orbiter to fail structurally. Pieces were exposed 
to higher heating for a longer period, resulting in more heat 
damage and ablation of left wing structural material. The left 
wing was also subjected to superheated air that penetrated 
directly  into  the  mid-body  of  the  wing  for  a  substantial 
period. This pre-heating likely rendered those components 
unable to absorb much, if any, of the post-breakup heating. 
Those internal and external structures were likely vaporized 
during  post-breakup  re-entry.  Finally,  the  left  wing  likely 
lost significant amounts of the Thermal Protection System 
prior to breakup due to the effect of internal wing heating on 
the Thermal Protection System bonding materials, and this 
further degraded the left wingʼs ability to resist the high heat 
of re-entry after it broke up.

Tile Slumping and External Patterns of Tile Loss

Tiles recovered from the lower left wing yielded their own 
interesting clues. The left wing lower carrier panel 9 tiles 
sustained extreme heat damage (slumping) and showed more 
signs of erosion than any other tiles. This severe heat erosion 
damage was likely caused by an outflow of superheated air 
and  molten  material  from  behind  RCC  panel  8  through 
a  U-shaped  design  gap  in  the  panel  (see  Figure  3.7-2)
that allows room for the T-seal attachment. Effluents from 
the back side of panel 8 would directly impact this area of 
lower carrier panel 9 and its tiles. In addition, flow lines in 
these tiles (see Figure 3.7-3) exhibit evidence of superheated 
airflow across their surface from the area of the RCC panel

the strength of the tile bond degraded, and tiles separated 
from the Orbiter.

Erosion of Left Wing Reinforced Carbon-Carbon

Several  pieces  of  left  wing  RCC  showed  unique  signs  of 
heavy  erosion  from  exposure  to  extreme  heat.  There  was 
erosion on two rib panels on the left wing leading edge in 
the RCC panel 8 and 9 interface. Both the outboard rib of 
panel 8 and the inboard rib of panel 9 showed signs of ex-
treme heating and erosion (see Figure 3.7-4). This erosion 
indicates that there was extreme heat behind RCC panels 8 
and 9. This type of RCC erosion was not seen on any other 
part of the left or right wing. 

Locations of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Debris

The location of debris on the ground also provided evidence 
of where the initial breach occurred. The location of every 
piece of recovered RCC was plotted on a map and labeled 
according to the panel the piece originally came from. Two 
distinct  patterns  were  immediately  evident.  First,  it  was 
clear that pieces from left wing RCC panels 9 through 22 
had fallen the farthest west, and that RCC from left wing 
panels 1 through 7 had fallen considerably farther east (see 
Figure 3.7-5). Second, pieces from left wing panel 8 were

the RCC panel 8 and 9 interface. The tiles shown are from behind 
the area where the superheated air exited from the slot in Figure

other tiles in this area and chemical analysis showed the presence

8 and 9 interface. Chemical analysis shows that these car-
rier panel tiles were covered with molten Inconel, which is 
found in wing leading edge attachment fittings, and other 
metals coming from inside the RCC cavity. Slumping and 
heavy erosion of this magnitude is not noted on tiles from 
anywhere else on the Orbiter. 

Failure modes of recovered tiles from the left and the right 
wing also differ. Most right wing tiles were simply broken 
off the wing due to aerodynamic forces, which indicates that 
they failed due to physical overload at breakup, not because 
of heat. Most of the tiles on the left wing behind RCC panels 
8  and  9  show  significant  evidence  of  backside  heating  of 
the wing skin and failure of the adhesive that held the tiles 
on the wing. This pattern of failure suggests that heat pen-
etrated the left wing cavity and then heated the aluminum 
skin from the inside out. As the aluminum skin was heated,

sion of this magnitude was not observed in any other location on

area  immediately  behind  left  wing  RCC  panels  8  and  9.  In  the

surface of the left wing. The more red an individual tile appears, 
the farther west it was found.

found throughout the debris field, which suggested that the 
left wing likely failed in the vicinity of RCC panel 8. The 
early loss of the left wing from RCC panel 9 and outboard 
caused the RCC from that area to be deposited well west 
of the RCC from the inboard part of the wing. Since panels 
1 through 7 were so much farther to the east, investigators 
concluded that RCC panels 1 through 7 had stayed with the 
Orbiter longer than had panels 8 through 22. 

Tile Locations

An analysis of where tiles were found on the ground also 
yielded  significant  evidence  of  the  breach  location.  Since 
most of the tiles are of similar size, weight, and shape, they 
would all have similar ballistic coefficients and would have 
behaved similarly after they separated from the Orbiter. By 
noting where each tile fell and then plotting its location on 
the Orbiter tile map, a distinctive pattern emerged. The tiles 
recovered farthest west all came from the area immediately 
behind the left wing RCC panel 8 and 9 (see Figure 3.7-6), 
which  suggests  that  these  tiles  were  released  earlier  than 
those from other areas of the left wing. While it is not con-
clusive evidence of a breach in this area, this pattern does 
suggest unique damage around RCC panels 8 and 9 that was 
not seen in other areas. Tiles from this area also showed evi-
dence of a brown deposit that was not seen on tiles from any 

other part of the Orbiter. Chemical analysis revealed it was 
an Inconel-based deposit that had come from inside the RCC 
cavity  on  the  left  wing  (Inconel  is  found  in  wing  leading 
edge attachment fittings). Since the streamlines from tiles 
with the brown deposit originate near left RCC panels 8 and 
9, this brown deposit likely originated as an outflow of su-
perheated air and molten metal from the panel 8 and 9 area.

Molten Deposits

High heat damage to metal parts caused molten deposits to 
form on some Orbiter debris. Early analysis of these depos-
its focused on their density and location. Much of the left 
wing leading edge showed some signs of deposits, but the 
left wing RCC panels 5 to 10 had the highest levels. 

Of all the debris pieces recovered, left wing panels 8 and 
9  showed  the  largest  amounts  of  deposits.  Significant  but 
lesser amounts of deposits were also observed on left wing 
RCC panels 5 and 7. Right wing RCC panel 8 was the only 
right-wing panel with significant deposits. 

Chemical and X-Ray Analysis

Chemical analysis focused on recovered pieces of RCC pan-
els with unusual deposits. Samples were obtained from areas

in the vicinity of left wing RCC panel 8 as well as other left 
and right wing RCC panels. Deposits on recovered RCC de-
bris were analyzed by cross-sectional optical and scanning 
electron microscopy, microprobe analysis, and x-ray diffrac-
tion to determine the content and layering of slag deposits. 
Slag was defined as metallic and non-metallic deposits that 
resulted  from  the  melting  of  the  internal  wing  structures. 
X-ray  analysis  determined  the  best  areas  to  sample  for 
chemical testing and to see if an overall flow pattern could 
be discerned. 

The X-ray analysis of left wing RCC panel 8 (see Figure 
3.7-7) showed a bottom-to-top pattern of slag deposits. In 
some  areas,  small  spheroids  of  heavy  metal  were  aligned 
vertically on the recovered pieces, which indicated a super-
heated airflow from the bottom of the panel toward the top 
in the area of RCC panel 8-left. These deposits were later 
determined by chemical analysis to be Inconel 718, prob-
ably from the wing leading edge attachment fittings on the 
spanner beams on RCC panels 8 and 9. Computational fluid 
dynamics modeling of the flow behind panel 8 indicated that 
the molten deposits would be laid down in this manner.

Figure 3.7-7. X-ray analysis of RCC panel 8-left showed a bottom-
to-top pattern of slag deposits.

The layered deposits on panel 8 were also markedly different 
from those on all other left- and right-wing panels. There was 
much more material deposited on RCC panel 8-left. These 
deposits  had  a  much  rougher  overall  structure,  including 
rivulets of Cerachrome slag deposited directly on the RCC. 
This indicated that Cerachrome, the insulation that protects 
the wing leading edge spar, was one of the first materials to 
succumb to the superheated air entering through the breach in 
RCC panel 8-left. Because the melting temperature of Cera-
chrome is greater than 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, analysis in-
dicated that materials in this area were exposed to extremely

high  temperatures  for  a  long  period.  Spheroids  of  Inconel 
718  were  mixed  in  with  the  Cerachrome.  Because  these 
spheroids (see Figure 3.7-8) were directly on the surface of 
the RCC and also in the first layers of deposits, investigators 
concluded that the Inconel 718 spanner beam RCC fittings 
were  most  likely  the  first  internal  structures  subjected  to 
intense  heating.  No  aluminum  was  detected  in  the  earliest 
slag layers on RCC panel 8-left. Only one location on an up-
per corner piece, near the spar fitting attachment, contained 
A-286 stainless steel. This steel was not present in the bottom 
layer of the slag directly on the RCC surface, which indicated 
that the A-286 attachment fittings on the wing spar were not 
in the direct line of the initial plume impingement.

In wing locations other than left RCC panels 8 and 9, the 
deposits were generally thinner and relatively uniform. This 
suggests no particular breach location other than in left RCC 
panels 8 and 9. These other slag deposits contained primarily 
aluminum and aluminum oxides mixed with A-286, Inconel, 
and Cerachrome, with no consistent layering. This mixing 
of multiple metals in no apparent order suggests concurrent 
melting and re-depositing of all leading-edge components, 
which  is  more  consistent  with  post-breakup  damage  than 
the organized melting and depositing of materials that oc-
curred near the original breach at left RCC panels 8 and 9. 
RCC panel 9-left also differs from the rest of the locations 
analyzed. It was similar to panel 8-left on the inboard side, 
but more like the remainder of the samples analyzed on its 
outboard side. The deposition of molten deposits strongly 
suggests the original breach occurred in RCC panel 8-left. 

Spanner Beams, Fittings, and Upper Carrier Panels 

Spanner beams, fittings, and upper carrier panels were recov-
ered from areas adjacent to most of the RCC panels on both 
wings. However, significant numbers of these items were not 
recovered from the vicinity of left RCC panels 6 to 10. None 
of the left wing upper carrier panels at positions 9, 10, or 11 
were recovered. No spanner beam parts were recovered from

STS-107 CREW SURVIVABILITY

At  the  Boardʼs  request,  NASA  formed  a  Crew  Survivability 
Working Group within two weeks of the accident to better un-
derstand the cause of crew death and the breakup of the crew 
module. This group made the following observations.

Medical and Life Sciences 

The Working Group found no irregularities in its extensive re-
view of all applicable medical records and crew health data. The 
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation conducted forensic analyses on the remains of the 
crew of Columbia after they were recovered. It was determined 
that the acceleration levels the crew module experienced prior 
to its catastrophic failure were not lethal. The death of the crew 
members was due to blunt trauma and hypoxia. The exact time 
of death – sometime after 9:00:19 a.m. Eastern Standard Time 
– cannot be determined because of the lack of direct physical or 
recorded evidence. 

Failure of the Crew Module

The forensic evaluation of all recovered crew module/forward 
fuselage components did not show any evidence of over-pres-
surization or explosion. This conclusion is supported by both 
the lack of forensic evidence and a credible source for either 
sort of event.11 The failure of the crew module resulted from the 
thermal degradation of structural properties, which resulted in a 
rapid catastrophic sequential structural breakdown rather than 
an instantaneous “explosive” failure. 

Separation of the crew module/forward fuselage assembly from 
the rest of the Orbiter likely occurred immediately in front of 
the payload bay (between Xo576 and Xo582 bulkheads). Sub-
sequent breakup of the assembly was a result of ballistic heating 

and dynamic loading. Evaluations of fractures on both primary 
and secondary structure elements suggest that structural failures 
occurred at high temperatures and in some cases at high strain 
rates.  An  extensive  trajectory  reconstruction  established  the 
most likely breakup sequence, shown below.

The load and heat rate calculations are shown for the crew mod-
ule along its reconstructed trajectory. The band superimposed 
on the trajectory (starting about 9:00:58 a.m. EST) represents 
the  window  where  all  the  evaluated  debris  originated.  It  ap-
pears that the destruction of the crew module took place over a 
period of 24 seconds beginning at an altitude of approximately 
140,000  feet  and  ending  at  105,000  feet.  These  figures  are 
consistent with the results of independent thermal re-entry and 
aerodynamic  models.  The  debris  footprint  proved  consistent 
with the results of these trajectory analyses and models. Ap-
proximately 40 to 50 percent, by weight, of the crew module 
was recovered.

The Working Groupʼs results significantly add to the knowledge 
gained from the loss of Challenger in 1986. Such knowledge is 
critical to efforts to improve crew survivability when designing 
new vehicles and identifying feasible improvements to the exist-
ing Orbiters. 

Crew Worn Equipment

Videos of the crew during re-entry that have been made public 
demonstrate  that  prescribed  procedures  for  use  of  equipment 
such as full-pressure suits, gloves, and helmets were not strictly 
followed.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  Working  Groupʼs  conclu-
sions that three crew members were not wearing gloves, and one 
was not wearing a helmet. However, under these circumstances, 
this did not affect their chances of survival.

BOARD TESTING
NASA and the Board agreed that tests would be required and 
a test plan developed to validate an impact/breach scenario. 
Initially, the Board intended to act only in an oversight role in 
the development and implementation of a test plan. However, 
ongoing and continually unresolved debate on the size and 
velocity of the foam projectile, largely due to the Marshall 
Space  Flight  Centerʼs  insistence  that,  despite  overwhelm-
ing evidence to the contrary, the foam could have been no 
larger than 855 cubic inches, convinced the Board to take a 
more active role. Additionally, in its assessment of potential 
foam damage NASA continued to rely heavily on the Crater 
model, which was used during the mission to determine that 
the  foam-shedding  event  was  non-threatening.  Crater  is  a 
semi-empirical model constructed from Apollo-era data. An-
other factor that contributed to the Boardʼs decision to play an 
active role in the test program was the Orbiter Vehicle Engi-
neering Working Groupʼs requirement that the test program 
be used to validate the Crater model. NASA failed to focus 
on physics-based pre-test predictions, the schedule priorities 
for RCC tests that were determined by transport analysis, the 
addition of appropriate test instrumentation, and the consid-
eration of additional factors such as launch loads. Ultimately, 
in discussions with the Orbiter Vehicle Engineering Working 
Group and the NASA Accident Investigation Team, the Board 
provided test plan requirements that outlined the template for 
all testing. The Board directed that a detailed written test plan, 
with Board-signature approval, be provided before each test.

the left RCC panel 8 to 10 area. No upper or lower RCC fit-
tings were recovered for left panels 8, 9, or 10. Some of this 
debris may not have been found in the search, but it is un-
likely that all of it was missed. Much of this structure prob-
ably melted, and was burned away by superheated air inside 
the wing. What did not melt was so hot that when it broke 
apart, it did not survive the heat of re-entry. This supports the 
theory that superheated air penetrated the wing in the general 
area of RCC panel 8-left and caused considerable structural 
damage to the left wing leading edge spar and hardware. 

Debris Analysis Conclusions

A  thorough  analysis  of  left  wing  debris  (independent  of 
the preceding aerodynamic, aerothermal, sensor, and photo 
data) supports the conclusion that significant abnormalities 
occurred in the vicinity of left RCC panels 8 and 9. The pre-
ponderance of debris evidence alone strongly indicates that 
the breach occurred in the bottom of panel 8-left. The unique 
composition of the slag found in panels 8 and 9, and espe-
cially on RCC panel 8-left, indicates extreme and prolonged 
heating in these areas very early in re-entry. 

The early loss of tiles in the region directly behind left RCC 
panels  8  and  9  also  supports  the  conclusion  that  a  breach 
through the wing leading edge spar occurred here. This al-
lowed superheated air to flow into the wing directly behind 
panel 8. The heating of the aluminum wing skin degraded tile 
adhesion and contributed to the early loss of tiles.

gesting that the breach in the RCC was through panel 8-left. 
It is noteworthy that it occurred only in this area and not 
in any other areas on either the left or the right wing lower 
carrier panels. There is also significant and unique evidence 
of severe “knife edges” erosion in left RCC panels 8 and 9. 
Lastly, the pattern of the debris field also suggests the left 
wing likely failed in the area of RCC panel 8-left.

The preponderance of unique debris evidence in and near 
RCC panel 8-left strongly suggests that a breach occurred 
here. Finally, the unique debris damage in the RCC panel 
8-left area is completely consistent with other data, such as 
the Modular Auxiliary Data System recorder, visual imagery 
analysis, and the aerodynamic and aerothermal analysis.

3.8  IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TESTING

The importance of understanding this potential impact dam-
age and the need to prove or disprove the impression that 
foam could not break an RCC panel prompted the investi-
gation  to  develop  computer  models  for  foam  impacts  and 
undertake an impact-testing program of shooting pieces of 
foam at a mockup of the wing leading edge to re-create, to 
the extent practical, the actual STS-107 debris impact event.

Based  on  imagery  analysis  conducted  during  the  mission 
and early in the investigation, the test plan included impacts 
on the lower wing tile, the left main landing gear door, the 
wing leading edge, and the carrier panels. 

A main landing gear door assembly was the first unit ready 
for testing. By the time that testing occurred, however, anal-
ysis was pointing to an impact site in RCC panels 6 through 
9. After the main landing gear door tests, the analysis and 
testing effort shifted to the wing leading edge RCC panel as-
semblies. The main landing gear door testing provided valu-
able data on test processes, equipment, and instrumentation. 
Insignificant  tile  damage  was  observed  at  the  low  impact 
angles of less than 20 degrees (the impact angle if the foam 
had  struck  the  main  landing  gear  door  would  have  been 
roughly five degrees). The apparent damage threshold was 
consistent with previous testing with much smaller projec-
tiles in 1999, and with independent modeling by Southwest 
Research Institute. (See Appendix D.12.)

Impact Test – Wing Leading Edge Panel Assemblies

Severe  damage  to  the  lower  carrier  panel  9-left  tiles  is 
indicative of a flow out of panel 8-left, also strongly sug-

The test concept was to impact flightworthy wing leading 
edge RCC panel assemblies with a foam projectile fired by

a compressed-gas gun. Target panel assemblies with a flight 
history similar to Columbiaʼs would be mounted on a sup-
port  that  was  structurally  equivalent  to  Columbiaʼs  wing. 
The attaching hardware and fittings would be either flight 
certified or built to Columbia drawings. Several consider-
ations influenced the overall RCC test design:

•  RCC panel assemblies were limited, particularly those 

with a flight history similar to Columbiaʼs.

•  The basic material properties of new RCC were known 
to be highly variable and were not characterized for high 
strain rate loadings typical of an impact.

•  The influence of aging was uncertain.
•  The RCCʼs brittleness allowed only one test impact on 
each panel to avoid the possibility that hidden damage 
would influence the results of later impacts.

•  The  structural  system  response  of  RCC  components, 
their  support  hardware,  and  the  wing  structure  was 
complex.

•  The  foam  projectile  had  to  be  precisely  targeted,  be-
cause the predicted structural response depended on the 
impact point.

Because of these concerns, engineering tests with fiberglass 
panel assemblies from the first Orbiter, Enterprise,12 were 
used to obtain an understanding of overall system response 
to various impact angles, locations, and foam orientations. 
The fiberglass panel impact tests were used to confirm in-
strumentation design and placement and the adequacy of the 
overall test setup.

Test projectiles were made from the same type of foam as 
the bipod ramp on STS-107ʼs External Tank. The projectileʼs 
mass  and  velocity  were  determined  by  the  previously  de-
scribed “best fit” image and transport analyses. Because the 
precise impact point was estimated, the aiming point for any 
individual  test  panel  was  based  on  structural  analyses  to 
maximize the loads in the area being assessed without pro-
ducing a spray of foam over the top of the wing. The angle 
of  impact  relative  to  the  test  panel  was  determined  from 

the transport analysis of the panel being tested. The foamʼs 
rotational  velocity  was  accounted  for  with  a  three-degree 
increase in the impact angle.

Computer Modeling of Impact Tests

The  investigation  used  sophisticated  computer  models  to 
analyze the foam impact and to help develop an impact test 
program. Because an exhaustive test matrix to cover all fea-
sible impact scenarios was not practical, these models were 
especially important to the investigation.

The investigation impact modeling team included members 
from Boeing, Glenn Research Center, Johnson Space Cen-
ter, Langley Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, 
Sandia National Laboratory, and Stellingwerf Consulting. 
The Board also contracted with Southwest Research Insti-
tute to perform independent computer analyses because of 
the instituteʼs extensive test and analysis experience with 
ballistic impacts, including work on the Orbiterʼs Thermal 
Protection  System.  (Appendix  D.12  provides  a  complete 
description of Southwestʼs impact modeling methods and 
results.)

The objectives of the modeling effort included (1) evalua-
tion of test instrumentation requirements to provide test data 
with which to calibrate the computer models, (2) prediction 
of stress, damage, and instrumentation response prior to the 
Test Readiness Reviews, and (3) determination of the flight 
conditions/loads (vibrations, aerodynamic, inertial, acoustic, 
and thermal) to include in the tests. In addition, the impact 
modeling team provided information about foam impact lo-
cations, orientation at impact, and impact angle adjustments 
that accounted for the foamʼs rotational velocity.

Flight Environment

A  comprehensive  consideration  of  the  Shuttleʼs  flight  en-
vironment, including temperature, pressure, and vibration, 
was required to establish the experimental protocol.

Based on the results of Glenn Research Center sub-scale im-
pact tests of how various foam temperatures and pressures 
influence the impact force, the Board found that full-scale 
impact  tests  with  foam  at  room  temperature  and  pressure 
could  adequately  simulate  the  conditions  during  the  foam 
strike on STS-107.13 

The structure of the foam complicated the testing process. 
The bipod ramp foam is hand-sprayed in layers, which cre-
ates “knit lines,” the boundaries between each layer, and the 
foam compression characteristics depend on the knit linesʼ 
orientation. The projectiles used in the full-scale impact tests 
had knit lines consistent with those in the bipod ramp foam. 

A primary concern of investigators was that external loads 
present in the flight environment might add substantial extra 
force to the left wing. However, analysis demonstrated that 
the only significant external loads on the wing leading edge 
structural subsystem at about 82 seconds into flight are due 
to random vibration and the pressure differences inside and 
outside the leading edge. The Board concluded that the flight 
environment stresses in the RCC panels and the attachment 
fittings  could  be  accounted  for  in  post-impact  analyses  if 
necessary. However, the dramatic damage produced by the 
impact tests demonstrated that the foam strike could breach 
the wing leading edge structure subsystem independent of 
any stresses associated with the flight environment. (Appen-
dix D.12 contains more detail.)

Test Assembly

The impact tests were conducted at a Southwest Research 
Institute facility. Figure 3.8-1 shows the nitrogen gas gun that 
had evaluated bird strikes on aircraft fuselages. The gun was 
modified to accept a 35-foot-long rectangular barrel, and the 
target site was equipped with sensors and high-speed camer-
as that photographed 2,000 to 7,000 frames per second, with 
intense light provided by theater spotlights and the sun. 

Test Impact Target

The leading edge structural subsystem test target was designed 
to accommodate the Boardʼs evolving determination of the 

most likely point of impact. Initially, analysis pointed to the 
main landing gear door. As the imaging and transport teams 
refined their assessments, the likely strike zone narrowed to 
RCC panels 6 through 9. Because of the long lead time to de-
velop and produce the large complex test assemblies, inves-
tigators developed an adaptable test assembly (Figure 3.8-2) 
that would provide a structurally similar mounting for RCC 
panel assemblies 5 to 10 and would accommodate some 200 
sensors, including high-speed cameras, strain and deflection 
gauges, accelerometers, and load cells.14 
Test Panels

RCC panels 6 and 9, which bracketed the likely impact re-
gion, were the first identified for testing. They would also 
permit a comparison of the structural response of panels with 
and without the additional thickness at certain locations.

Panel 6 tests demonstrated the complex system response to 
impacts. While the initial focus of the investigation had been 
on single panel response, early results from the tests with 
fiberglass  panels  hinted  at  “boundary  condition”  effects. 
Instruments measured high stresses through panels 6, 7, and 
8. With this in mind, as well as forensic and sensor evidence 
that panel 8 was the likeliest location of the foam strike, the 
Board decided that the second RCC test should target panel 
8, which was placed in an assembly that included RCC pan-
els 9 and 10 to provide high fidelity boundary conditions. 
The decision to impact test RCC panel 8 was complicated 
by the lack of spare RCC components.

The  specific  RCC  panel  assemblies  selected  for  testing 
had flight histories similar to that of STS-107, which was 
Columbiaʼs 28th flight. Panel 6 had flown 30 missions on 
Discovery, and Panel 8 had flown 26 missions on Atlantis.

Test Projectile

The  preparation  of  BX-250  foam  test  projectiles  used  the 
same material and preparation processes that produced the 
foam bipod ramp. Foam was selected as the projectile mate-
rial because foam was the most likely debris, and materials 
other than foam would represent a greater threat.

The  testing  required  a  projectile  (see  Figure  3.8-3)  made 
from standard stock, so investigators selected a rectangular 
cross-section  of  11.5  by  5.5  inches,  which  was  within  15 
percent of the footprint of the mean debris size initially esti-
mated by image analysis. To account for the foamʼs density, 
the projectile length was cut to weigh 1.67 pounds, a figure 
determined by image and transport analysis to best repre-
sent the STS-107 projectile. For foam with a density of 2.4 
pounds per cubic foot,15 the projectile dimensions were 19 
inches by 11.5 inches by 5.5 inches.

Impact Angles

The precise impact location of the foam determined the im-
pact angle because the debris was moving almost parallel to 
the Orbiterʼs fuselage at impact. Tile areas would have been 
hit  at  very  small  angles  (approximately  five  degrees),  but 
the curvature of the leading edge created angles closer to 20 
degrees (see Figure 3.4-4). 

The foam that struck Columbia on January 16, 2003, had 
both a translational speed and a rotational speed relative to 
the Orbiter. The translational velocity was easily replicated 
by adjusting the gas pressure in the gun. The rotational en-
ergy could be calculated, but the impact force depends on 
the  material  composition  and  properties  of  the  impacting 
body and how the rotating body struck the wing. Because 
the details of the foam contact were not available from any 
visual evidence, analysis estimated the increase in impact 
energy that would be imparted by the rotation. These analy-
ses resulted in a three-degree increase in the angle at which 
the foam test projectile would hit the test panel.16 

The “clocking angle” was an additional consideration. As 
shown in Figure 3.8-4, the gun barrel could be rotated to 
change the impact point of the foam projectile on the leading 
edge. Investigators conducted experiments to determine if 
the corner of the foam block or the full edge would impart a

adjust the impact point of the foam projectile.

greater force. During the fiberglass tests, it was found that a 
clocking angle of 30 degrees allowed the 11.5-inch-edge to 
fully contact the panel at impact, resulting in a greater local 
force than a zero degree angle, which was achieved with the 
barrel aligned vertically. A zero-degree angle was used for 
the test on RCC panel 6, and a 30-degree angle was used for 
RCC panel 8.

Test Results from Fiberglass Panel Tests 1-5

Five engineering tests on fiberglass panels (see Figure 3.8-5) 
established the test parameters of the impact tests on RCC 
panels. Details of the fiberglass tests are in Appendix D.12.

Test Results from Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Panel 6 
(From Discovery)

RCC  panel  6  was  tested  first  to  begin  to  establish  RCC 
impact  response,  although  by  the  time  of  the  test,  other 
data  had  indicated  that  RCC  panel  8-left  was  the  most 
likely  site  of  the  breach.  RCC  panel  6  was  impacted  us-
ing  the  same  parameters  as  the  test  on  fiberglass  panel  6 
and developed a 5.5-inch crack on the outboard end of the 
panel that extended through the rib (see Figure 3.8-6). There 
was also a crack through the “web” of the T-seal between 
panels 6 and 7 (see Figure 3.8-7). As in the fiberglass test, 
the  foam  block  deflected,  or  moved,  the  face  of  the  RCC 
panel,  creating  a  slit  between  the  panel  and  the  adjacent 
T-seal, which ripped the projectile and stuffed pieces of foam 
into the slit (see Figure 3.8-8). The panel rib failed at lower 
stresses than predicted, and the T-seal failed closer to predic-
tions, but overall, the stress pattern was similar to what was 
predicted, demonstrating the need to incorporate more com-
plete RCC failure criteria in the computational models.

Without  further  crack  growth,  the  specific  structural  dam-
age  this  test  produced  would  probably  not  have  allowed 
enough superheated air to penetrate the wing during re-entry 
to cause serious damage. However, the test did demonstrate 
that a foam impact representative of the debris strike at 81.9 
seconds after launch could damage an RCC panel. Note that

the RCC panel 6-left test used fiberglass panels and T-seals in

panel 6, 7, and 8 configuration might have resulted in more 
severe damage.

Test Results from Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Panel 8 
(From Atlantis) 

The second impact test of RCC material used panel 8 from 
Atlantis, which had flown 26 missions. Based on forensic 
evidence, sensor data, and aerothermal studies, panel 8 was 
considered the most likely point of the foam debris impact 
on Columbia.

Based  on  the  system  response  of  the  leading  edge  in  the 
fiberglass and RCC panel 6 impact tests, the adjacent RCC 
panel assemblies (9 and 10) were also flown hardware. The

at 777 feet per second with a clocking angle of 30 degrees 
and an angle of incidence of 25.1 degrees.

The impact created a hole roughly 16 inches by 17 inches, 
which was within the range consistent with all the findings 
of the investigation (see Figure 3.8-9). Additionally, cracks 
in the panel ranged up to 11 inches in length (Figure 3.8-10). 
The T-seal between panels 8 and 9 also failed at the lower 
outboard mounting lug. 

Three large pieces of the broken panel face sheet (see Fig-
ure 3.8-11) were retained within the wing. The two largest 
pieces had surface areas of 86 and 75 square inches. While 
this test cannot exactly duplicate the damage Columbia in-
curred, pieces such as these could have remained in the wing 
cavity for some time, and could then have floated out of the 
damaged wing while the Orbiter was maneuvering in space. 
This scenario is consistent with the event observed on Flight 
Day 2 (see Section 3.5).

The test clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type 
Columbia sustained could seriously breach the Wing Lead-
ing Edge Structural Subsystem.

Conclusion

At the beginning of this chapter, the Board stated that the 
physical cause of the accident was a breach in the Thermal 
Protection System on the leading edge of the left wing. The 
breach was initiated by a piece of foam that separated from 
the left bipod ramp of the External Tank and struck the wing 
in the vicinity of the lower half of the Reinforced Carbon-
Carbon (RCC) panel 8.

The conclusion that foam separated from the External Tank 
bipod ramp and struck the wing in the vicinity of panel 8 is 
documented by photographic evidence (Section 3.4). Sensor 
data and the aerodynamic and thermodynamic analyses (Sec-
tion 3.6) based on that data led to the determination that the 
breach was in the vicinity of panel 8 and also accounted for 
the subsequent melting of the supporting structure, the spar, 
and the wiring behind the spar that occurred behind panel 
8. The detailed examination of the debris (Section 3.7) also 
pointed to panel 8 as the breach site. The impact tests (Sec-
tion 3.8) established that foam can breach the RCC, and also 
counteracted the lingering denial or discounting of the ana-
lytic evidence. Based on this evidence, the Board concluded 
that  panel  8  was  the  site  of  the  foam  strike  to  Columbia
during the liftoff of STS-107 on January 23, 2003.

Findings:

F3.8-1 

F3.8-2 

The impact test program demonstrated that foam 
can cause a wide range of impact damage, from 
cracks to a 16- by 17-inch hole.
The wing leading edge Reinforced Carbon-Car-
bon  composite  material  and  associated  support 
hardware are remarkably tough and have impact 
capabilities  that  far  exceed  the  minimal  impact 
resistance  specified  in  their  original  design  re-
quirements. Nevertheless, these tests demonstrate 
that this inherent toughness can be exceeded by

impacts representative of those that occurred dur-
ing Columbiaʼs ascent.
The response of the wing leading edge to impacts 
is complex and can vary greatly, depending on the 
location of the impact, projectile mass, orienta-
tion, composition, and the material properties of 
the panel assembly, making analytic predictions 
of damage to RCC assemblies a challenge.17
Testing  indicates  the  RCC  panels  and  T-seals 
have much higher impact resistance than the de-
sign specifications call for.
NASA has an inadequate number of spare Rein-
forced Carbon-Carbon panel assemblies.
NASAʼs current tools, including the Crater mod-
el,  are  inadequate  to  evaluate  Orbiter  Thermal 
Protection System damage from debris impacts 
during pre-launch, on-orbit, and post-launch ac-
tivity.
The bipod ramp foam debris critically damaged 
the leading edge of Columbiaʼs left wing.

Recommendations:

R3.8-1 

R3.8-2 

Obtain  sufficent  spare  Reinforced  Carbon-Car-
bon  panel  assemblies  and  associated  support 
components  to  ensure  that  decisions  related  to 
Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  maintenance  are 
made on the basis of component specifications, 
free  of  external  pressures  relating  to  schedules, 
costs, or other considerations.
Develop,  validate,  and  maintain  physics-based 
computer models to evaluate Thermal Protection 
System damage from debris impacts. These tools 
should provide realistic and timely estimates of 
any  impact  damage  from  possible  debris  from 
any  source  that  may  ultimately  impact  the  Or-
biter.  Establish  impact  damage  thresholds  that 
trigger responsive corrective action, such as on-
orbit inspection and repair, when indicated.

CHAPTER 4

Other Factors Considered

During its investigation, the Board evaluated every known 
factor that could have caused or contributed to the Colum-
bia  accident,  such  as  the  effects  of  space  weather  on  the 
Orbiter  during  re-entry  and  the  specters  of  sabotage  and 
terrorism.  In  addition  to  the  analysis/scenario  investiga-
tions,  the  Board  oversaw  a  NASA  “fault  tree”  investiga-
tion, which accounts for every chain of events that could 
possibly cause a system to fail. Most of these factors were 
conclusively eliminated as having nothing to do with the 
accident; however, several factors have yet to be ruled out. 
Although  deemed  by  the  Board  as  unlikely  to  have  con-
tributed to the accident, these are still open and are being 
investigated further by NASA. In a few other cases, there 
is  insufficient  evidence  to  completely  eliminate  a  factor, 
though most evidence indicates that it did not play a role in 
the accident. In the course of investigating these factors, the 
Board identified several serious problems that were not part 
of the accidentʼs causal chain but nonetheless have major 
implications for future missions. 

In this chapter, a discussion of these potential causal and 
contributing factors is divided into two sections. The first 
introduces the primary tool used to assess potential causes 
of the breakup: the fault tree. The second addresses fault 
tree items and particularly notable factors that raised con-
cerns for this investigation and, more broadly, for the future 
operation of the Space Shuttle. 
4.1  FAULT TREE 

The  NASA  Accident  Investigation  Team  investigated  the 
accident using “fault trees,” a common organizational tool 
in systems engineering. Fault trees are graphical represen-
tations of every conceivable sequence of events that could 
cause  a  system  to  fail.  The  fault  treeʼs  uppermost  level 
illustrates the events that could have directly caused the loss 
of Columbia by aerodynamic breakup during re-entry. Subse-
quent levels comprise all individual elements or factors that 
could cause the failure described immediately above it. In 
this way, all potential chains of causation that lead ultimately 
to the loss of Columbia can be diagrammed, and the behavior 
of every subsystem that was not a precipitating cause can be 
eliminated from consideration. Figure 4.1-1 depicts the fault 
tree structure for the Columbia accident investigation.

Figure 4.1-1. Accident investigation fault tree structure.

NASA chartered six teams to develop fault trees, one for each 
of the Shuttleʼs major components: the Orbiter, Space Shuttle 
Main  Engine,  Reusable  Solid  Rocket  Motor,  Solid  Rocket 
Booster,  External  Tank,  and  Payload.  A  seventh  “systems 
integration” fault tree team analyzed failure scenarios involv-
ing two or more Shuttle components. These interdisciplinary 
teams included NASA and contractor personnel, as well as 
outside experts.

Some of the fault trees are very large and intricate. For in-
stance,  the  Orbiter  fault  tree,  which  only  considers  events 
on the Orbiter that could have led to the accident, includes 
234 elements. In contrast, the Systems Integration fault tree, 
which  deals  with  interactions  among  parts  of  the  Shuttle, 
includes  295  unique  multi-element  integration  faults,  128 
Orbiter multi-element faults, and 221 connections to the other 
Shuttle  components. These  faults  fall  into  three  categories: 
induced and natural environments (such as structural inter-
face loads and electromechanical effects); integrated vehicle 
mass properties; and external impacts (such as debris from the 
External Tank). Because the Systems Integration team consid-
ered multi-element faults – that is, scenarios involving several 
Shuttle components – it frequently worked in tandem with the 
Component teams.

In the case of the Columbia accident, there could be two 
plausible explanations for the aerodynamic breakup of the 
Orbiter: (1) the Orbiter sustained structural damage that un-
dermined attitude control during re-entry; or (2) the Orbiter 
maneuvered to an attitude in which it was not designed to 
fly. The  former  explanation  deals  with  structural  damage 
initiated before launch, during ascent, on orbit, or during 
re-entry. The latter considers aerodynamic breakup caused 
by improper attitude or trajectory control by the Orbiterʼs 
Flight Control System. Telemetry and other data strongly 
suggest that improper maneuvering was not a factor. There-
fore, most of the fault tree analysis concentrated on struc-
tural damage that could have impeded the Orbiterʼs attitude 
control, in spite of properly operating guidance, navigation, 
and flight control systems. 

When investigators ruled out a potential cascade of events, 
as represented by a branch on the fault tree, it was deemed 
“closed.” When evidence proved inconclusive, the item re-
mained “open.” Some elements could be dismissed at a high 
level in the tree, but most required delving into lower levels. 
An intact Shuttle component or system (for example, a piece 
of Orbiter debris) often provided the basis for closing an ele-
ment. Telemetry data can be equally persuasive: it frequently 
demonstrated that a system operated correctly until the loss 
of signal, providing strong evidence that the system in ques-
tion did not contribute to the accident. The same holds true 
for data obtained from the Modular Auxiliary Data System 
recorder, which was recovered intact after the accident.

The closeout of particular chains of causation was exam-
ined at various stages, culminating in reviews by the NASA 
Orbiter Vehicle Engineering Working Group and the NASA 
Accident  Investigation  Team.  After  these  groups  agreed 
to close an element, their findings were forwarded to the 
Board for review. At the time of this reportʼs publication, 
the Board had closed more than one thousand items. A sum-
mary of fault tree elements is listed in Figure 4.1-2.

Figure  4.1-2.  Summary  of  fault  tree  elements  reviewed  by  the 
Board.

The open elements are grouped by their potential for con-
tributing either directly or indirectly to the accident. The first 
group contains elements that may have in any way contrib-

uted to the accident. Here, “contributed” means that the ele-
ment may have been an initiating event or a likely cause of 
the accident. The second group contains elements that could 
not be closed and may or may not have contributed to the 
accident. These elements are possible causes or factors in 
this accident. The third group contains elements that could 
not be closed, but are unlikely to have contributed to the ac-
cident. Appendix D.3 lists all the elements that were closed 
and thus eliminated from consideration as a cause or factor 
of this accident. 

Some of the element closure efforts will continue after this 
report is published. Some elements will never be closed, be-
cause there is insufficient data and analysis to uncondition-
ally conclude that they did not contribute to the accident. For 
instance, heavy rain fell on Kennedy Space Center prior to 
the launch of STS-107. Could this abnormally heavy rainfall 
have compromised the External Tank bipod foam? Experi-
ments showed that the foam did not tend to absorb rain, but 
the rain could not be ruled out entirely as having contributed 
to the accident. Fault tree elements that were not closed as of 
publication are listed in Appendix D.4.
4.2  REMAINING FACTORS 

Several significant factors caught the attention of the Board 
during the investigation. Although it appears that they were 
not causal in the STS-107 accident, they are presented here 
for completeness.

Solid Rocket Booster Bolt Catchers

The fault tree review brought to light a significant problem 
with  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster  bolt  catchers.  Each  Solid 
Rocket Booster is connected to the External Tank by four 
separation bolts: three at the bottom plus a larger one at the 
top that weighs approximately 65 pounds. These larger upper 
(or “forward”) separation bolts (one on each Solid Rocket 
Booster) and their associated bolt catchers on the External 
Tank provoked a great deal of Board scrutiny. 

About two minutes after launch, the firing of pyrotechnic 
charges breaks each forward separation bolt into two pieces, 
allowing the spent Solid Rocket Boosters to separate from 
the External Tank (see Figure 4.2-1). Two “bolt catchers” on 
the External Tank each trap the upper half of a fired separa-
tion bolt, while the lower half stays attached to the Solid 
Rocket Booster. As a result, both halves are kept from flying 
free of the assembly and potentially hitting the Orbiter. Bolt 
catchers have a domed aluminum cover containing an alu-
minum honeycomb matrix that absorbs the fired boltʼs en-
ergy. The two upper bolt halves and their respective catchers 
subsequently remain connected to the External Tank, which 
burns up on re-entry, while the lower halves stay with the 
Solid Rocket Boosters that are recovered from the ocean.

If one of the bolt catchers failed during STS-107, the result-
ing  debris  could  have  damaged  Columbiaʼs  wing  leading 
edge. Concerns that the bolt catchers may have failed, caus-
ing  metal  debris  to  ricochet  toward  the  Orbiter,  arose  be-
cause the configuration of the bolt catchers used on Shuttle 
missions differs in important ways from the design used in

initial qualification tests.1 First, the attachments that current-
ly hold bolt catchers in place use bolts threaded into inserts 
rather than through-bolts. Second, the test design included 
neither the Super Lightweight Ablative material applied to 
the  bolt  catcher  apparatus  for  thermal  protection,  nor  the 
aluminum  honeycomb  configuration  currently  used. Also, 
during these initial tests, temperature and pressure readings 
for the bolt firings were not recorded.

Instead  of  conducting  additional  tests  to  correct  for  these 
discrepancies,  NASA  engineers  qualified  the  flight  design 
configuration using a process called “analysis and similar-
ity.” The flight configuration was validated using extrapo-
lated test data and redesign specifications rather than direct 
testing. This means that NASAʼs rationale for considering 
bolt catchers to be safe for flight is based on limited data 
from  testing  24  years  ago  on  a  model  that  differs  signifi-
cantly from the current design. 

Due  to  these  testing  deficiencies,  the  Board  recognized 
that  bolt  catchers  could  have  played  a  role  in  damaging 
Columbiaʼs  left  wing.  The  aluminum  dome  could  have 
failed catastrophically, ablative coating could have come off 
in large quantities, or the device could have failed to hold to 
its mount point on the External Tank. To determine whether 
bolt catchers should be eliminated as a source of debris, in-
vestigators conducted tests to establish a performance base-
line for bolt catchers in their current configuration and also 
reviewed radar data to see whether bolt catcher failure could 
be  observed.  The  results  had  serious  implications:  Every 
bolt catcher tested failed well below the expected load range 
of 68,000 pounds. In one test, a bolt catcher failed at 44,000 
pounds, which was two percent below the 46,000 pounds 

generated  by  a  fired  separation  bolt.  This  means  that  the 
force at which a separation bolt is predicted to come apart 
during flight could exceed the bolt catcherʼs ability to safely 
capture the bolt. If these results are consistent with further 
tests, the factor of safety for the bolt catcher system would 
be 0.956 – far below the design requirement of 1.4 (that is, 
able to withstand 1.4 times the maximum load ever expected 
in operation).

Every bolt catcher must be inspected (via X-ray) as a final 
step  in  the  manufacturing  process  to  ensure  specification 
compliance. There are specific requirements for film type/
quality to allow sufficient visibility of weld quality (where 
the dome is mated to the mounting flange) and reveal any 
flaws. There is also a requirement to archive the film for sev-
eral years after the hardware has been used. The manufac-
turer is required to evaluate the film, and a Defense Contract 
Management  Agency  representative  certifies  that  require-
ments have been met. The substandard performance of the 
Summa  bolt  catchers  tested  by  NASA  at  Marshall  Space 
Flight  Center  and  subsequent  investigation  revealed  that 
the contractorʼs use of film failed to meet quality require-
ments and, because of this questionable quality, there were 
“probable” weld defects in most of the archived film. Film 
of STS-107ʼs bolt catchers (serial numbers 1 and 19, both 
Summa-manufactured), was also determined to be substan-
dard  with  “probable”  weld  defects  (cracks,  porosity,  lack 
of penetration) on number 1 (left Solid Rocket Booster to 
External Tank attach point). Number 19 appeared adequate, 
though the substandard film quality leaves some doubt. 

Further  investigation  revealed  that  a  lack  of  qualified 
non-destructive  inspection  technicians  and  differing  inter-
pretations  of  inspection  requirements  contributed  to  this 
oversight.  United  Space  Alliance,  NASAʼs  agent  in  pro-
curing  bolt  catchers,  exercises  limited  process  oversight 
and  delegates  actual  contract  compliance  verification  to 
the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency.  The  Defense 
Contract Management Agency interpreted its responsibility 
as limited to certifying compliance with the requirement for 
X-ray inspections. Since neither the Defense Contract Man-
agement Agency nor United Space Alliance had a resident 
non-destructive inspection specialist, they could not read the 
X-ray film or certify the weld. Consequently, the required 
inspections of weld quality and end-item certification were 
not properly performed. Inadequate oversight and confusion 
over the requirement on the parts of NASA, United Space 
Alliance, and the Defense Contract Management Agency all 
contributed to this problem. 

In  addition,  STS-107  radar  data  from  the  U.S. Air  Force 
Eastern Range tracking system identified an object with a 
radar cross-section consistent with a bolt catcher departing 
the Shuttle stack at the time of Solid Rocket Booster separa-
tion. The resolution of the radar return was not sufficient to 
definitively identify the object. However, an object that has 
about the same radar signature as a bolt catcher was seen on 
at least five other Shuttle missions. Debris shedding during 
Solid  Rocket  Booster  separation  is  not  an  unusual  event. 
However, the size of this object indicated that it could be a 
potential threat if it came close to the Orbiter after coming 
off the stack.

Although bolt catchers can be neither definitively excluded 
nor  included  as  a  potential  cause  of  left  wing  damage  to 
Columbia,  the  impact of  such  a  large  object would  likely 
have registered on the Shuttle stackʼs sensors. The indefinite 
data at the time of Solid Rocket Booster separation, in tan-
dem with overwhelming evidence related to the foam debris 
strike,  leads  the  Board  to  conclude  that  bolt  catchers  are 
unlikely to have been involved in the accident.

The  certification  of  the  bolt  catchers  flown  on 
STS-107  was  accomplished  by  extrapolating 
analysis  done  on  similar  but  not  identical  bolt 
catchers in original testing. No testing of flight 
hardware was performed.
Board-directed  testing  of  a  small  sample  size 
demonstrated  that  the  “as-flown”  bolt  catchers 
do not have the required 1.4 margin of safety.
Quality assurance processes for bolt catchers (a 
Criticality 1 subsystem) were not adequate to as-
sure contract compliance or product adequacy.
An  unknown  metal  object  was  seen  separating 
from the stack during Solid Rocket Booster sepa-
ration during six Space Shuttle missions. These 
objects were not identified, but were character-
ized as of little to no concern.

Recommendations:

ers.

Kapton Wiring

Because of previous problems with its use in the Space Shut-
tle and its implication in aviation accidents, Kapton-insulated 
wiring  was  targeted  as  a  possible  cause  of  the  Columbia
accident.  Kapton  is  an  aromatic  polyimide  insulation  that 
the  DuPont  Corporation  developed  in  the  1960s.  Because 
Kapton is lightweight, nonflammable, has a wide operating 
temperature  range,  and  resists  damage,  it  has  been  widely 
used in aircraft and spacecraft for more than 30 years. Each 
Orbiter contains 140 to 157 miles of Kapton-insulated wire, 
approximately 1,700 feet of which is inaccessible. 

Despite its positive properties, decades of use have revealed 
one  significant  problem  that  was  not  apparent  during  its 
development and initial use: Kapton insulation can break 
down,  leading  to  a  phenomenon  known  as  arc  tracking. 
When arc tracking occurs, the insulation turns to carbon, or 
carbonizes, at temperatures of 1,100 to 1,200 degrees Fahr-
enheit. Carbonization is not the same as combustion. Dur-
ing tests unrelated to Columbia, Kapton wiring placed in an 
open flame did not continue to burn when the wiring was 
removed  from  the  flame.  Nevertheless,  when  carbonized, 
Kapton becomes a conductor, leading to a “soft electrical 
short”  that  causes  systems  to  gradually  fail  or  operate  in 
a degraded fashion. Improper installation and mishandling 
during inspection and maintenance can also cause Kapton 
insulation to split, crack, flake, or otherwise physically de-
grade.2 (Arc tracking is pictured in Figure 4.2-2.)

Perhaps the greatest concern is the breakdown of the wireʼs 
insulation  when  exposed  to  moisture.  Over  the  years,  the 
Federal Aviation Administration  has  undertaken  extensive 
studies  into  wiring-related  issues,  and  has  issued  Advi-
sory  Circulars  (25-16  and  43.13-1B)  on  aircraft  wiring 
that  discuss  using  aromatic  polyimide  insulation.  It  was 
discovered that as long as the wiring is designed, installed, 
and maintained properly, it is safe and reliable. It was also 
discovered, however, that the aromatic polyimide insulation 
does  not  function  well  in  high-moisture  environments,  or 
in  installations  that  require  large  or  frequent  flexing.  The 
military had discovered the potentially undesirable aspects 
of aromatic polyimide insulation much earlier, and had ef-
fectively banned its use on new aircraft beginning in 1985. 
These rules, however, apply only to pure polyimide insula-
tion;  various  other  insulations  that  contain  polyimide  are 
still used in appropriate areas.

The first extensive scrutiny of Kapton wiring on any of the 
Orbiters  occurred  during  Columbiaʼs  third  Orbiter  Major 
Modification period, after a serious system malfunction dur-
ing the STS-93 launch of Columbia in July 1999. A short cir-
cuit five seconds after liftoff caused two of the six Main En-
gine Controller computers to lose power, which could have 
caused one or two of the three Main Engines to shut down. 
The ensuing investigation identified damaged Kapton wire 
as the cause of the malfunction. In order to identify and cor-
rect such wiring problems, all Orbiters were grounded for an 
initial (partial) inspection, with more extensive inspections 
planned during their next depot-level maintenance. During 
Columbiaʼs subsequent Orbiter Major Modification, wiring 
was inspected and redundant system wiring in the same bun-
dles was separated to prevent arc tracking damage. Nearly 
4,900  wiring  nonconformances  (conditions  that  did  not 
meet specifications) were identified and corrected. Kapton-
related problems accounted for approximately 27 percent of 
the  nonconformances. This  examination revealed  a  strong 
correlation between wire damage and the Orbiter areas that 
had  experienced  the  most  foot  traffic  during  maintenance 
and modification.3

Other  aspects  of  Shuttle  operation  may  degrade  Kapton 
wiring. In orbit, atomic oxygen acts as an oxidizing agent, 
causing  chemical  reactions  and  physical  erosion  that  can 
lead to mass loss and surface property changes. Fortunately, 
actual exposure has been relatively limited, and inspections 
show that degradation is minimal. Laboratory tests on Kap-
ton also confirm that on-orbit ultraviolet radiation can cause 
delamination, shrinkage, and wrinkling. 

Finding:

F4.2-5 

Based on the extensive wiring inspections, main-
tenance,  and  modifications  prior  to  STS-107, 
analysis of sensor/wiring failure signatures, and 
the  alignment  of  the  signatures  with  thermal 
intrusion  into  the  wing,  the  Board  found  no 
evidence that Kapton wiring problems caused or 
contributed to this accident.

Recommendation:

R4.2-2 

As part of the Shuttle Service Life Extension Pro-
gram and potential 40-year service life, develop a 
state-of-the-art means to inspect all Orbiter wir-
ing, including that which is inaccessible.

Crushed Foam

Based  on  the  anticipated  launch  date  of  STS-107,  a  set 
of Solid Rocket Boosters had been stacked in the Vehicle 
Assembly  Building  and  a  Lightweight  Tank  had  been  at-
tached to them. A reshuffling of the manifest in July 2002 
resulted in a delay to the STS-107 mission.5 It was decided 
to  use  the  already-stacked  Solid  Rocket  Boosters  for  the 
STS-113  mission  to  the  International  Space  Station.  All 
flights to the International Space Station use Super Light-
weight Tanks, meaning that the External Tank already mated 
would need to be removed and stored pending the rescheduled 
STS-107 mission. Since External Tanks are not stored with 
the  bipod  struts  attached,  workers  at  the  Kennedy  Space 
Center removed the bipod strut from the Lightweight Tank 
before it was lifted into a storage cell.6 

Following  the  de-mating  of  the  bipod  strut,  an  area  of 
crushed PDL-1034 foam was found in the region beneath 
where the left bipod strut attached to the tankʼs –Y bipod 
fitting. The region measured about 1.5 inches by 1.25 inches 
by 0.187 inches and was located at roughly the five oʼclock 
position. Foam thickness in this region was 2.187 inches.

Figure 4.2-4. Typical wiring harness protection methods.

Figure 4.2-3. Typical wiring bundle inside Orbiter wing.

A  typical  wiring  bundle  is  shown  in  Figure  4.2-3.  Wiring 
nonconformances  are  corrected  by  rerouting,  reclamping, 
or  installing  additional  insulation  such  as  convoluted  tub-
ing, insulating tape, insulating sheets, heat shrink sleeving, 
and  abrasion  pads  (see  Figure  4.2-4).  Testing  has  shown 
that wiring bundles usually stop arc tracking when wires are 
physically  separated  from  one  another.  Further  testing  un-
der conditions simulating the Shuttleʼs wiring environment 
demonstrated that arc tracking does not progress beyond six 
inches.  Based  on  these  results,  Boeing  recommended  that 
NASA separate all critical paths from larger wire bundles and 
individually protect them for a minimum of six inches be-
yond their separation points.4 This recommendation is being 
adopted through modifications performed during scheduled 
Orbiter Major Modifications. For example, analysis of tele-
metered data from 14 of Columbiaʼs left wing sensors (hy-
draulic line/wing skin/wheel temperatures, tire pressures, and 
landing gear downlock position indication) provided failure 
signatures supporting the scenario of left-wing thermal intru-
sion, as opposed to a catastrophic failure (extensive arc track-
ing) of Kapton wiring. Actual NASA testing in the months 
following  the  accident,  during  which  wiring  bundles  were 
subjected to intense heat (ovens, blowtorch, and arc jet), veri-
fied the failure signature analyses. Finally, extensive testing 
and analysis in years prior to STS-107 showed that, with the 
low currents and low voltages associated with the Orbiterʼs 
instrumentation system (such as those in the left wing), the 
probability of arc tracking is commensurately low.

The crushed foam was exposed when the bipod strut was 
removed.  This  constituted  an  unacceptable  condition  and 
required a Problem Report write-up.7

NASA conducted testing at the Michoud Assembly Facility 
and at Kennedy Space Center to determine if crushed foam 
could have caused the loss of the left bipod ramp, and to de-
termine if the limits specified in Problem Report procedures 
were sufficient for safety.8 

Kennedy engineers decided not to take action on the crushed 
foam because it would be covered after the External Tank 
was mated to a new set of bipod struts that would connect 
it to Columbia, and the struts would sufficiently contain and 
shield the crushed foam.9 An inspection after the bipod struts 
were attached determined that the area of crushed foam was 
within limits specified in the drawing for this region.10

STS-107 was therefore launched with crushed foam behind 
the clevis of the left bipod strut. Crushed foam in this region 
is a routine occurrence because the foam is poured and shaved 
so that the mating of the bipod strut to the bipod fitting results 
in a tight fit between the bipod strut and the foam. 

Pre-launch testing showed that the extent of crushed foam 
did not exceed limits.11 In these tests, red dye was wicked 
into  the  crushed  (open)  foam  cells,  and  the  damaged  and 
dyed foam was then cut out and examined. Despite the ef-
fects of crushing, the foamʼs thickness around the bipod at-
tach point was not substantially reduced; the foam effective-
ly maintained insulation against ice and frost. The crushed 
foam was contained by the bipod struts and was subjected to 
little or no airflow. 

Finding:

F4.2-6 

Crushed foam does not appear to have contrib-
uted to the loss of the bipod foam ramp off the 
External Tank during the ascent of STS-107.

Hypergolic Fuel Spill

Concerns  that  hypergolic  (ignites  spontaneously  when 
mixed)  fuel  contamination  might  have  contributed  to  the 
accident led the Board to investigate an August 20, 1999, 
hydrazine spill at Kennedy Space Center that occurred while 
Columbia was being prepared for shipment to the Boeing 
facility in Palmdale, California. The spill occurred when a 
maintenance technician disconnected a hydrazine fuel line 
without capping it. When the fuel line was placed on a main-
tenance platform, 2.25 ounces of the volatile, corrosive fuel 
dripped onto the trailing edge of the Orbiterʼs left inboard 
elevon. After  the  spill  was  cleaned  up,  two  tiles  were  re-
moved for inspection. No damage to the control surface skin 
or structure was found, and the tiles were replaced.12

United Space Alliance briefed all employees working with 
these systems on procedures to prevent another spill, and on 

November 1, 1999, the Shuttle Operations Advisory Group 
was briefed on the corrective action that had been taken. 

Finding:

F4.2-7 

The hypergolic spill was not a factor in this ac-
cident.

Space Weather

Space weather refers to the action of highly energetic par-
ticles in the outer layers of Earthʼs atmosphere. Eruptions of 
particles from the sun are the primary source of space weath-
er events, which fluctuate daily or even more frequently. The 
most common space weather concern is a potentially harmful 
radiation dose to astronauts during a mission. Particles can 
also  cause  structural  damage  to  a  vehicle,  harm  electronic 
components, and adversely affect communication links.

After the accident, several researchers contacted the Board 
and  NASA  with  concerns  about  unusual  space  weather 
just  before  Columbia  started  its  re-entry. A  coronal  mass 
ejection,  or  solar  flare,  of  high-energy  particles  from  the 
outer layers of the sunʼs atmosphere occurred on January 31, 
2003. The shock wave from the solar flare passed Earth at 
about the same time that the Orbiter began its de-orbit burn. 
To examine the possible effects of this solar flare, the Board 
enlisted the expertise of the Space Environmental Center of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and 
the  Space Vehicles  Directorate  of  the Air  Force  Research 
Laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts.

Measurements from multiple space- and ground-based sys-
tems indicate that the solar flare occurred near the edge of 
the sun (as observed from Earth), reducing the impact of the 
subsequent shock wave to a glancing blow. Most of the ef-
fects of the solar flare were not observed on Earth until six 
or more hours after Columbia broke up. See Appendix D.5 
for more on space weather effects. 

Finding:

F4.2-8 

Space weather was not a factor in this accident.

Asymmetric Boundary Layer Transition

Columbia had recently been through a complete refurbish-
ment,  including  detailed  inspection  and  certification  of  all 
lower  wing  surface  dimensions.  Any  grossly  protruding 
gap fillers would have been observed and repaired. Indeed, 
though investigators found that Columbiaʼs reputation for a 
rough left wing was well deserved prior to STS-75, quantita-
tive measurements show that the measured wing roughness 
was below the fleet average by the launch of STS-107.13

Training and On-Orbit Performance

All  mission-specific  training  requirements  for  STS-107 
launch and flight control operators were completed before 
launch  with  no  performance  problems.  However,  seven 
flight  controllers  assigned  to  the  mission  did  not  have 
current recertifications at the time of the Flight Readiness 
Review, nor were they certified by the mission date. (Most 
flight controllers must recertify for their positions every 18 
months.) The Board has determined that this oversight had 
no  bearing  on  mission  performance  (see  Chapter  6).  The 
Launch Control Team and crew members held a full “dress 
rehearsal” of the launch day during the Terminal Countdown 
Demonstration Test. See Appendix D.1 for additional details 
on training for STS-107.

Because the majority of the mission was completed before 
re-entry,  an  assessment  of  the  training  preparation  and 
flight  readiness  of  the  crew,  launch  controllers,  and  flight 
controllers  was  based  on  the  documented  performance 
of  mission  duties.  All  STS-107  personnel  performed 
satisfactorily  during 
launch, 
and  mission.  Crew  and  mission  controller  actions  were 
consistent with re-entry procedures.

There  were  a  few  incorrect  switch  movements  by  the 
crew during the mission, including the configuration of an 
inter-communications  switch  and  an  accidental  bump  of 
a  rotational  hand  controller  (which  affected  the  Orbiterʼs 
attitude) after the de-orbit burn but prior to Entry Interface. 
The inter-communications switch error was identified and 
then  corrected  by  the  crew;  both  the  crew  and  Mission 
Control noticed the bump and took the necessary steps to 
place  the  Orbiter  in  the  correct  attitude.  Neither  of  these 
events was a factor in the accident, nor are they considered 
training or performance issues. Details on STS-107 on-orbit 
operations are in Appendix D.2. 

Finding:

F4.2-10  The  Board  concludes  that  training  and  on-orbit 

considerations were not factors in this accident.

Recommendations:

Payloads

To ensure that a payload malfunction did not cause or con-
tribute  to  the  Columbia  accident,  the  Board  conducted  a 
thorough examination of all payloads and their integration 
with the Orbiterʼs systems. The Board reviewed all down-
linked payload telemetry data during the mission, as well as 

all payload hardware technical documentation. Investigators 
assessed every payload readiness review, safety review, and 
payload integration process used by NASA, and interviewed 
individuals involved in the payload process at both Johnson 
and Kennedy Space Centers. 

The Boardʼs review of the STS-107 Flight Readiness Review, 
Payload  Readiness  Review,  Payload  Safety  Review  Panel, 
and Integrated Safety Assessments of experiment payloads 
on STS-107 found that all payload-associated hazards were 
adequately identified, accounted for, and appropriately miti-
gated. Payload integration engineers encountered no unique 
problems during SPACEHAB integration, there were no pay-
load constraints on the launch, and there were no guideline 
violations during the payload preparation process.

The  Board  evaluated  11  payload  anomalies,  one  of  which 
was  significant. A  SPACEHAB Water  Separator Assembly 
leak  under  the  aft  sub-floor  caused  an  electrical  short  and 
subsequent shutdown of both Water Separator Assemblies. 
Ground and flight crew responses sufficiently addressed these 
anomalies during the mission. Circuit protection and telem-
etry data further indicate that during re-entry, this leak could 
not have produced a similar electrical short in SPACEHAB 
that might have affected the main Orbiter power supply.

The  Board  determined  that  the  powered  payloads  aboard 
STS-107 were performing as expected when the Orbiterʼs 
signal was lost. In addition, all potential “fault-tree” payload 
failures that could have contributed to the Orbiter breakup 
were evaluated using real-time downlinked telemetry, debris 
analysis, or design specification analysis. These analyses in-
dicate that no such failures occurred.

Several  experiments  within  SPACEHAB  were  flammable, 
used flames, or involved combustible materials. All down-
linked SPACEHAB telemetry was normal through re-entry, 
indicating  no  unexpected  rise  in  temperature  within  the 
module and no increases in atmospheric or hull pressures. 
All fire alarms and indicators within SPACEHAB were op-
erational, and they detected no smoke or fire. Gas percent-
ages within SPACEHAB were also within limits.

Because  a  major  shift  in  the  Orbiterʼs  center  of  gravity 
could  potentially  cause  flight-control  or  heat  management 
problems,  researchers  investigated  a  possible  shifting  of 
equipment  in  the  payload  bay.  Telemetry  during  re-entry 
indicated that all payload cooling loops, electrical wiring, 
and  communications  links  were  functioning  as  expected, 
supporting the conclusion that no payload came loose dur-
ing re-entry. In addition, there are no indications from the 
Orbiterʼs telemetry that any flight control adjustments were 
made to compensate for a change in the Orbiterʼs center of 
gravity, which indicates that the center of gravity in the pay-
load bay did not shift during re-entry.

The Board explored whether the pressurized SPACEHAB 
module may have ruptured during re-entry. A rupture could 
breach  the  fuselage  of  the  Orbiter  or  force  open  the  pay-
load bay doors, allowing hot gases to enter the Orbiter. All 
downlinked payload telemetry indicates that there was no 
decompression of SPACEHAB prior to loss of signal, and

Willful Damage and Security

During  the  Boardʼs  investigation,  suggestions  of  willful 
damage, including the possibility of a terrorist act or sabo-
tage by a disgruntled employee, surfaced in the media and 
on  various  Web  sites.  The  Board  assessed  such  theories, 
giving  particular  attention  to  the  unprecedented  security 
precautions taken during the launch of STS-107 because of 
prevailing national security concerns and the inclusion of an 
Israeli crew member. 

Speculation that Columbia was shot down by a missile was 
easily  dismissed.  The  Orbiterʼs  altitude  and  speed  prior 
to  breakup  was  far  beyond  the  reach  of  any  air-to-air  or 
surface-to-air  missile,  and  telemetry  and  Orbiter  support 
system data demonstrate that events leading to the breakup 
began at even greater altitudes.

The  Boardʼs  evaluation  of  whether  sabotage  played  any 
role included several factors: security planning and counter-
measures, personnel and facility security, maintenance and 
processing procedures, and debris analysis.

To rule out an act of sabotage by an employee with access 
to these facilities, maintenance and processing procedures 
were thoroughly reviewed. The Board also interviewed em-
ployees who had access to the Orbiter.

The processes in place to detect anything unusual on the Or-
biter, from a planted explosive to a bolt incorrectly torqued, 
make it likely that anything unusual would be caught during 
the many checks that employees perform as the Orbiter nears 
final closeout (closing and sealing panels that have been left 
open for inspection) prior to launch. In addition, the process 
of securing various panels before launch and taking close-
out  photos  of  hardware  (see  Figure  4.2-5)  almost  always 
requires the presence of more than one person, which means 
a saboteur would need the complicity of at least one other 
employee, if not more.

Debris from Columbia was examined for traces of explo-
sives that would indicate a bomb onboard. Federal Bureau 
of Investigation laboratories provided analysis. Laboratory 
technicians took multiple samples of debris specimens and 
compared  them  with  swabs  from  Atlantis  and  Discovery. 
Visual  examination  and  gas  chromatography  with  chemi-
luminescence detection found no explosive residues on any 
specimens that could not be traced to the Shuttleʼs pyrotech-

nic devices. Additionally, telemetry and other data indicate 
these pyrotechnic devices operated normally. 

In its review of willful damage scenarios mentioned in the 
press or submitted to the investigation, the Board could not 
find any that were plausible. Most demonstrated a basic lack 
of knowledge of Shuttle processing and the physics of explo-
sives, altitude, and thermodynamics, as well as the processes 
of maintenance documentation and employee screening.

NASA  and  its  contractors  have  a  comprehensive  security 
system, outlined in documents like NASA Policy Directive 
1600.2A. Rules, procedures, and guidelines address topics 
ranging from foreign travel to information security, from se-
curity education to investigations, and from the use of force 
to security for public tours.

The Board examined security at NASA and its related fa-
cilities through a combination of employee interviews, site 
visits, briefing reviews, and discussions with security per-
sonnel. The Board focused primarily on reviewing the capa-
bility of unauthorized access to Shuttle system components. 
Facilities and programs examined for security and sabotage 
potential  included ATK Thiokol  in  Utah  and  its  Reusable 
Solid Rocket Motor production, the Michoud Assembly Fa-
cility in Louisiana and its External Tank production, and the 
Kennedy Space Center in Florida for its Orbiter and overall 
integration responsibilities.

The Board visited the Boeing facility in Palmdale, Califor-
nia; Edwards Air Force Base in California; Stennis Space 
Center in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi; Marshall Space Flight 
Center near Huntsville, Alabama; and Cape Canaveral Air 
Force Station in Florida. These facilities exhibited a variety 
of  security  processes,  according  to  each  siteʼs  unique  de-
mands. At Kennedy, access to secure areas requires a series 
of  identification  card  exchanges  that  electronically  record 
each entry. The Michoud Assembly Facility employs similar 
measures, with additional security limiting access to a com-
pleted  External  Tank.  The  use  of  closed-circuit  television 
systems complemented by security patrols is universal. 

Employee  screening  and  tracking  measures  appear  solid 
across NASA and at the contractors examined by the Board. 
The agency relies on standard background and law enforce-
ment checks to prevent the hiring of applicants with ques-
tionable records and the dismissal of those who may accrue 
such a record.

It is difficult for anyone to access critical Shuttle hardware 
alone or unobserved by a responsible NASA or contractor 
employee. With the exception of two processes when foam 
is applied to the External Tank at the Michoud Assembly 
Facility, there are no known final closeouts of any Shuttle 
component that can be completed with fewer than two peo-
ple. Most closeouts involve at least five to eight employees 
before the component is sealed and certified for flight. All 
payloads also undergo an extensive review to ensure proper 
processing and to verify that they pose no danger to the crew 
or the Orbiter.

Security reviews also occur at locations such as the Trans-
oceanic Abort  Landing  facilities. These  sites  are  assessed 
prior  to  launch,  and  appropriate  measures  are  taken  to 
guarantee they are secure in case an emergency landing is 
required. NASA also has contingency plans in place, includ-
ing dealing with bioterrorism.

Both daily and launch-day security at the Kennedy Space 
Center  has  been  tightened  in  recent  years.  Each  Shuttle 
launch has an extensive security countdown, with a variety 
of  checks  to  guarantee  that  signs  are  posted,  beaches  are 
closed, and patrols are deployed. K-9 patrols and helicopters 
guard the launch area against intrusion.

Because the STS-107 manifest included Israelʼs first astro-
naut, security measures, developed with National Security 
Council approval, went beyond the normally stringent pre-
cautions, including the development of a Security Support 
Plan. 

Military  aircraft  patrolled  a  40-mile  Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration-restricted  area  starting  nine  hours  before  the 
launch of STS-107. Eight Coast Guard vessels patrolled a 
three-nautical-mile  security  zone  around  Kennedy  Space 
Center  and  Cape  Canaveral Air  Force  Station,  and  Coast 
Guard and NASA boats patrolled the inland waterways. Se-
curity forces were doubled on the day of the launch. 

Findings:

was a factor in this accident.

Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris Risks

Micrometeoroids  and  space  debris  (often  called  “space 
junk”)  are  among  the  most  serious  risk  factors  in  Shuttle 
missions. While  there  is  little  evidence  that  micrometeor-
oids or space debris caused the loss of Columbia, and in fact 

a review of on-board accelerometer data rules out a major 
strike, micrometeoroids or space debris cannot be entirely 
ruled out as a potential or contributing factor. 

Micrometeoroids,  each  usually  no  larger  than  a  grain  of 
sand, are numerous and particularly dangerous to orbiting 
spacecraft. Traveling at velocities that can exceed 20,000 
miles  per  hour,  they  can  easily  penetrate  the  Orbiterʼs 
skin. In contrast to micrometeoroids, orbital debris gener-
ally  comes  from  destroyed  satellites,  payload  remnants, 
exhaust  from  solid  rockets,  and  other  man-made  objects, 
and typically travel at far lower velocities. Pieces of debris 
four inches or larger are catalogued and tracked by the U.S. 
Air Force Space Command so they can be avoided during 
flight.

NASA has developed computer models to predict the risk 
of impacts. The Orbital Debris Model 2000 (ORDEM2000) 
database is used to predict the probability of a micromete-
oroid or space debris collision with an Orbiter, based on its 
flight trajectory, altitude, date, and duration. Development 
of the database was based on radar tracking of debris and 
satellite  experiments,  as  well  as  inspections  of  returned 
Orbiters. The computer code BUMPER translates expected 
debris hits from ORDEM2000 into an overall risk probabil-
ity for each flight. The worst-case scenario during orbital 
debris  strikes  is  known  as  the  Critical  Penetration  Risk, 
which can include the depressurization of the crew module, 
venting  or  explosion  of  pressurized  systems,  breaching 
of the Thermal Protection System, and damage to control 
surfaces. 

NASA guidelines require the Critical Penetration Risk to 
be better than 1 in 200, a number that has been the subject 
of several reviews. NASA has made changes to reduce the 
probability. For STS-107, the estimated risk was 1 in 370, 
though the actual as-flown value turned out to be 1 in 356. 
The current risk guideline of 1 in 200 makes space debris or 
micrometeoroid strikes by far the greatest risk factor in the 
Probabilistic Risk Assessment used for missions. Although 
1-in-200 flights may seem to be long odds, and many flights 
have exceeded the guideline, the cumulative risk for such 
a  strike  over  the  113-flight  history  of  the  Space  Shuttle 
Program  is  calculated  to  be  1  in  3. The  Board  considers 
this probability of a critical penetration to be unacceptably 
high. The Space Stationʼs micrometeoroid and space debris 
protection  system  reduces  its  critical  penetration  risk  to 
five percent or less over 10 years, which translates into a 
per-mission risk of 1 in 1,200 with 6 flights per year, or 60 
flights over 10 years.

To improve crew and vehicle safety over the next 10 to 20 
years, the Board believes risk guidelines need to be changed 
to compel the Shuttle Program to identify and, more to the 
point, reduce the micrometeoroid and orbital debris threat 
to missions.

Findings:

F4.2-15  There  is  little  evidence  that  Columbia  encoun-
tered either micrometeoroids or orbital debris on 
this flight.

F4.2-16  The Board found markedly different criteria for 
margins  of  micrometeoroid  and  orbital  debris 
safety  between  the  International  Space  Station 
and the Shuttle.

Recommendation:

R4.2-4 

Require the Space Shuttle to be operated with the 
same  degree  of  safety  for  micrometeoroid  and 
orbital debris as the degree of safety calculated 
for  the  International  Space  Station.  Change  the 
micrometeoroid and orbital debris safety criteria 
from guidelines to requirements. 

Orbiter Major Modification 

The Board investigated concerns that mistakes, mishaps, or 
human  error  during  Columbiaʼs  last  Orbiter  Major  Modi-
fication  might  have  contributed  to  the  accident.  Orbiters 
are removed from service for inspection, maintenance, and 
modification approximately every eight flights or three years. 
Columbia began its last Orbiter Major Modification in Sep-
tember 1999, completed it in February 2001, and had flown 
once before STS-107. Several aspects of the Orbiter Major 
Modification process trouble the Board, and need to be ad-
dressed  for  future  flights. These  concerns  are  discussed  in 
Chapter 10.

Findings:

F4.2-17  Based on a thorough investigation of maintenance 
records and interviews with maintenance person-
nel, the Board found no errors during Columbiaʼs 
most recent Orbiter Major Modification that con-
tributed to the accident. 

Recommendations:

•  None

Foreign Object Damage Prevention

Problems with the Kennedy Space Center and United Space 
Alliance  Foreign  Object  Damage  Prevention  Program, 
which in the Department of Defense and aviation industry 
typically falls under the auspices of Quality Assurance, are 
related to changes made in 2001. In that year, Kennedy and 
Alliance redefined the single term “Foreign Object Damage” 
– an industry-standard blanket term – into two terms: “Pro-
cessing Debris” and “Foreign Object Debris.”

Recognition  and  Inspection  Program  (HRIP)  walk-
downs, or as part of “Clean As You Go” practices.14

Foreign Object Debris then became:

Processing debris becomes FOD when it poses a poten-
tial risk to the Shuttle or any of its components, and only 
occurs when the debris is found during or subsequent to 
a final/flight Closeout Inspection, or subsequent to OMI 
S0007 ET Load SAF/FAC walkdown.15

These definitions are inconsistent with those of other NASA 
centers,  Naval  Reactor  programs,  the  Department  of  De-
fense,  commercial  aviation,  and  National Aerospace  FOD 
Prevention  Inc.  guidelines.16 They  are  unique  to  Kennedy 
Space Center and United Space Alliance.

Because debris of any kind has critical safety implications, 
these definitions are important. The United Space Alliance 
Foreign  Object  Program  includes  daily  debris  checks  by 
management  to  ensure  that  workers  comply  with  United 
Space Allianceʼs “clean as you go” policy, but United Space 
Alliance statistics reveal that the success rate of daily debris 
checks is between 70 and 86 percent.17 

The perception among many interviewees is that these novel 
definitions  mitigate  the  impact  of  Kennedy  Mission  As-
surance-found Foreign Object Debris on the United Space 
Alliance  award  fee.  This  is  because  “Processing  Debris” 
statistics do not directly affect the award fee. Simply put, 
in splitting “Foreign Object Damage” into two categories, 
many of the violations are tolerated. Indeed, with 18 prob-
lem reports generated on “lost items” during the processing 
of STS-107 alone, the need for an ongoing, thorough, and 
stringent  Foreign  Object  Debris  program  is  indisputable. 
However, with two definitions of foreign objects – Process-
ing Debris and Foreign Object Debris – the former is por-
trayed as less significant and dangerous than the latter. The 
assumption that all debris will be found before flight fails to 
underscore the destructive potential of Foreign Object De-
bris, and creates an incentive to simply accept “Processing 
Debris.”

Finding:

F4.2-18 

Since  2001,  Kennedy  Space  Center  has  used  a 
non-standard  approach  to  define  foreign  object 
debris. The industry standard term “Foreign Ob-
ject Damage” has been divided into two catego-
ries, one of which is much more permissive.

Processing Debris then became:

Recommendation:

Any material, product, substance, tool or aid generally 
used during the processing of flight hardware that re-
mains in the work area when not directly in use, or that 
is left unattended in the work area for any length of time 
during the processing of tasks, or that is left remaining 
or forgotten in the work area after the completion of a 
task or at the end of a work shift. Also any item, mate-
rial or substance in the work area that should be found 
and removed as part of standard housekeeping, Hazard 

R4.2-5 

Kennedy  Space  Center  Quality  Assurance  and 
United Space Alliance must return to the straight-
forward, industry-standard definition of “Foreign 
Object  Debris,”  and  eliminate  any  alternate  or 
statistically deceptive definitions like “processing 
debris.”

the  use  of  a  Super  Light  Weight  Tank,  ET-93  (which  is  a  Light  Weight

bipod struts to ET-93 was performed in anticipation of an Orbiter mate. 
Once STS-107 was delayed and ET-93 had to be de-mated from the Solid

Part Two

Why The Accident Occurred

Many  accident  investigations  do  not  go  far  enough.  They 
identify the technical cause of the accident, and then connect 
it to a variant of “operator error” – the line worker who forgot 
to insert the bolt, the engineer who miscalculated the stress, 
or the manager who made the wrong decision. But this is sel-
dom the entire issue. When the determinations of the causal 
chain are limited to the technical flaw and individual failure, 
typically the actions taken to prevent a similar event in the fu-
ture are also limited: fix the technical problem and replace or 
retrain the individual responsible. Putting these corrections in 
place leads to another mistake – the belief that the problem is 
solved. The Board did not want to make these errors. 

Attempting  to  manage  high-risk  technologies  while  mini-
mizing  failures  is  an  extraordinary  challenge.  By  their 
nature, these complex technologies are intricate, with many 
interrelated parts. Standing alone, the components may be 
well understood and have failure modes that can be antici-
pated. Yet when these components are integrated into a larg-
er system, unanticipated interactions can occur that lead to 
catastrophic outcomes. The risk of these complex systems is 
increased when they are produced and operated by complex 
organizations that also break down in unanticipated ways. 

In our view, the NASA organizational culture had as much 
to do with this accident as the foam. Organizational culture 
refers to the basic values, norms, beliefs, and practices that 
characterize the functioning of an institution. At the most ba-
sic level, organizational culture defines the assumptions that 
employees make as they carry out their work. It is a powerful 
force that can persist through reorganizations and the change 
of key personnel. It can be a positive or a negative force. 

In  a  report  dealing  with  nuclear  wastes,  the  National  Re-
search Council quoted Alvin Weinbergʼs classic statement 
about  the  “Faustian  bargain”  that  nuclear  scientists  made 
with society. “The price that we demand of society for this 
magical energy source is both a vigilance and a longevity of 
our social institutions that we are quite unaccustomed to.”  
This is also true of the space program. At NASAʼs urging, the 
nation committed to building an amazing, if compromised, 

vehicle called the Space Shuttle. When the agency did this, 
it accepted the bargain to operate and maintain the vehicle 
in the safest possible way. The Board is not convinced that 
NASA has completely lived up to the bargain, or that Con-
gress and the Administration has provided the funding and 
support necessary for NASA to do so. This situation needs to 
be addressed – if the nation intends to keep conducting hu-
man space flight, it needs to live up to its part of the bargain.

Part  Two  of  this  report  examines  NASAʼs  organizational, 
historical, and cultural factors, as well as how these factors 
contributed to the accident. As in Part One, this part begins 
with  history.  Chapter  5  examines  the  post-Challenger  his-
tory of NASA and its Human Space Flight Program. This 
includes reviewing the budget as well as organizational and 
management history, such as shifting management systems 
and  locations.  Chapter  6  documents  management  perfor-
mance related to Columbia to establish events analyzed in 
later chapters. The chapter reviews the foam strikes, intense 
schedule pressure driven by an artificial requirement to de-
liver Node 2 to the International Space Station by a certain 
date, and NASA managementʼs handling of concerns regard-
ing Columbia during the STS-107 mission. 

In Chapter 7, the Board presents its views of how high-risk 
activities  should  be  managed,  and  lists  the  characteristics 
of  institutions  that  emphasize  high-reliability  results  over 
economic efficiency or strict adherence to a schedule. This 
chapter measures the Space Shuttle Programʼs organizational 
and management practices against these principles and finds 
them wanting. Chapter 7 defines the organizational cause and 
offers recommendations. Chapter 8 draws from the previous 
chapters on history, budgets, culture, organization, and safety 
practices, and analyzes how all these factors contributed to 
this accident. This chapter captures the Boardʼs views of the 
need  to  adjust  management  to  enhance  safety  margins  in 
Shuttle  operations,  and  reaffirms  the  Boardʼs  position  that 
without  these  changes,  we  have  no  confidence  that  other 
“corrective actions” will improve the safety of Shuttle opera-
tions. The changes we recommend will be difficult to accom-
plish – and will be internally resisted.

CHAPTER 5

From Challenger
to Columbia

The  Board  is  convinced  that  the  factors  that  led  to  the 
Columbia accident go well beyond the physical mechanisms 
discussed in Chapter 3. The causal roots of the accident can 
also be traced, in part, to the turbulent post-Cold War policy 
environment in which NASA functioned during most of the 
years between the destruction of Challenger and the loss of 
Columbia. The end of the Cold War in the late 1980s meant 
that  the  most  important  political  underpinning  of  NASAʼs 
Human Space Flight Program – U.S.-Soviet space competi-
tion – was lost, with no equally strong political objective to 
replace it. No longer able to justify its projects with the kind 
of urgency that the superpower struggle had provided, the 
agency could not obtain budget increases through the 1990s. 
Rather than adjust its ambitions to this new state of affairs, 
NASA  continued  to  push  an  ambitious  agenda  of  space 
science  and  exploration,  including  a  costly  Space  Station 
Program. 

If NASA wanted to carry out that agenda, its only recourse, 
given its budget allocation, was to become more efficient, 
accomplishing more at less cost. The search for cost reduc-
tions led top NASA leaders over the past decade to downsize 
the  Shuttle  workforce,  outsource  various  Shuttle  Program 
responsibilities – including safety oversight – and consider 
eventual  privatization  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Program.  The 
programʼs budget was reduced by 40 percent in purchasing 
power over the past decade and repeatedly raided to make 
up  for  Space  Station  cost  overruns,  even  as  the  Program 
maintained  a  launch  schedule  in  which  the  Shuttle,  a  de-
velopmental vehicle, was used in an operational mode. In 
addition, the uncertainty of top policymakers in the White 
House,  Congress,  and  NASA  as  to  how  long  the  Shuttle 
would  fly  before  being  replaced  resulted  in  the  delay  of 
upgrades needed to make the Shuttle safer and to extend its 
service life. 

The Space Shuttle Program has been transformed since the 
late 1980s implementation of post-Challenger management 
changes in ways that raise questions, addressed here and in 
later chapters of Part Two, about NASAʼs ability to safely 

operate the Space Shuttle. While it would be inaccurate to 
say that NASA managed the Space Shuttle Program at the 
time of the Columbia accident in the same manner it did prior 
to Challenger, there are unfortunate similarities between the 
agencyʼs performance and safety practices in both periods. 
5.1  THE CHALLENGER ACCIDENT
 

AND ITS AFTERMATH

The  inherently  vulnerable  design  of  the  Space  Shuttle, 
described in Chapter 1, was a product of policy and tech-
nological compromises made at the time of its approval in 
1972.  That  approval  process  also  produced  unreasonable 
expectations,  even  myths,  about  the  Shuttleʼs  future  per-
formance that NASA tried futilely to fulfill as the Shuttle 
became “operational” in 1982. At first, NASA was able to 
maintain the image of the Shuttle as an operational vehicle. 
During its early years of operation, the Shuttle launched sat-
ellites, performed on-orbit research, and even took members 
of Congress into orbit. At the beginning of 1986, the goal of 
“routine access to space” established by President Ronald 
Reagan in 1982 was ostensibly being achieved. That appear-
ance soon proved illusory. On the cold morning of January 
28, 1986, the Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into 
its climb towards orbit. On board were Francis R. Scobee, 
Michael  J.  Smith,  Ellison  S.  Onizuka,  Judith A.  Resnick, 
Ronald E. McNair, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, and Gregory 
B. Jarvis. All perished. 

Rogers Commission

On February 3, 1986, President Reagan created the Presiden-
tial Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, 
which soon became known as the Rogers Commission after 
its chairman, former Secretary of State William Rogers. The 
Commissionʼs report, issued on June 6, 1986, concluded that 
the loss of Challenger was caused by a failure of the joint 
and seal between the two lower segments of the right Solid 
Rocket Booster. Hot gases blew past a rubber O-ring in the 
joint, leading to a structural failure and the explosive burn-

ing of the Shuttleʼs hydrogen fuel. While the Rogers Com-
mission  identified  the  failure  of  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster 
joint and seal as the physical cause of the accident, it also 
noted a number of NASA management failures that contrib-
uted to the catastrophe.

The Rogers Commission concluded “the decision to launch 
the  Challenger  was  flawed.”  Communication  failures, 
incomplete and misleading information, and poor manage-
ment  judgments  all  figured  in  a  decision-making  process 
that permitted, in the words of the Commission, “internal 
flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.” As 
a result, if those making the launch decision “had known all 
the facts, it is highly unlikely that they would have decided 
to launch.” Far from meticulously guarding against potential 
problems, the Commission found that NASA had required 
“a contractor to prove that it was not safe to launch, rather 
than proving it was safe.”1

The Commission also found that NASA had missed warn-
ing signs of the impending accident. When the joint began 
behaving in unexpected ways, neither NASA nor the Solid 
Rocket  Motor  manufacturer  Morton-Thiokol  adequately 
tested  the  joint  to  determine  the  source  of  the  deviations 
from specifications or developed a solution to them, even 
though the problems frequently recurred. Nor did they re-
spond  to  internal  warnings  about  the  faulty  seal.  Instead, 
Morton-Thiokol  and  NASA  management  came  to  see  the 
problems as an acceptable flight risk – a violation of a design 
requirement that could be tolerated.2 

During this period of increasing uncertainty about the jointʼs 
performance,  the  Commission  found  that  NASAʼs  safety 
system  had  been  “silent.”  Of  the  management,  organiza-
tional, and communication failures that contributed to the 
accident,  four  related  to  faults  within  the  safety  system, 
including “a lack of problem reporting requirements, inad-
equate  trend  analysis,  misrepresentation  of  criticality,  and 
lack  of  involvement  in  critical  discussions.”3  The  checks 
and balances the safety system was meant to provide were 
not working.

Still another factor influenced the decisions that led to the 
accident. The Rogers Commission noted that the Shuttleʼs 
increasing  flight  rate  in  the  mid-1980s  created  schedule 
pressure, including the compression of training schedules, 
a shortage of spare parts, and the focusing of resources on 
near-term  problems.  NASA  managers  “may  have  forgot-
ten–partly because of past success, partly because of their 
own  well-nurtured  image  of  the  program–that  the  Shuttle 
was still in a research and development phase.”4

The Challenger accident had profound effects on the U.S. 
space program. On August 15, 1986, President Reagan an-
nounced that “NASA will no longer be in the business of 
launching private satellites.” The accident ended Air Force 
and intelligence community reliance on the Shuttle to launch 
national security payloads, prompted the decision to aban-
don the yet-to-be-opened Shuttle launch site at Vandenberg 
Air Force Base, and forced the development of improved 
expendable launch vehicles.6 A 1992 White House advisory 
committee concluded that the recovery from the Challenger 

SELECTED ROGERS COMMISSION 
RECOMMENDATIONS

•  “The  faulty  Solid  Rocket  Motor  joint  and  seal  must 
be  changed.  This  could  be  a  new  design  eliminating 
the joint or a redesign of the current joint and seal. No 
design options should be prematurely precluded because 
of schedule, cost or reliance on existing hardware. All 
Solid Rocket Motor joints should satisfy the following: 
•  “The  joints  should  be  fully  understood,  tested  and 

verified.”

•  “The certification of the new design should include: 
•  Tests which duplicate the actual launch configu-

ration as closely as possible. 

•  Tests over the full range of operating conditions, 

including temperature.”

•  “Full consideration should be given to conducting static 
firings of the exact flight configuration in a vertical at-
titude.”

•  “The  Shuttle  Program  Structure  should  be  reviewed. 
The  project  managers  for  the  various  elements  of  the 
Shuttle  program  felt  more  accountable  to  their  center 
management than to the Shuttle program organization.”
•  “NASA  should  encourage  the  transition  of  qualified 

astronauts into agency management positions.”

•  “NASA should establish an Office of Safety, Reliability 
and Quality Assurance to be headed by an Associate Ad-
ministrator, reporting directly to the NASA Administra-
tor. It would have direct authority for safety, reliability, 
and quality assurance throughout the agency. The office 
should be assigned the work force to ensure adequate 
oversight of its functions and should be independent of 
other NASA functional and program responsibilities.”

•  “NASA should establish an STS Safety Advisory Panel 
reporting to the STS Program Manager. The charter of 
this  panel  should  include  Shuttle  operational  issues, 
launch commit criteria, flight rules, flight readiness and 
risk management.”

•  “The  Commission  found  that  Marshall  Space  Flight 
Center  project  managers,  because  of  a  tendency  at 
Marshall to management isolation, failed to provide full 
and timely information bearing on the safety of flight 
51-L  [the  Challenger  mission]  to  other  vital  elements 
of Shuttle program management … NASA should take 
energetic  steps  to  eliminate  this  tendency  at  Marshall 
Space Flight Center, whether by changes of personnel, 
organization, indoctrination or all three.”

•  “The  nationʼs  reliance  on  the  Shuttle  as  its  principal 
space launch capability created a relentless pressure on 
NASA to increase the flight rate … NASA must estab-
lish a flight rate that is consistent with its resources.”5

disaster cost the country $12 billion, which included the cost 
of building the replacement Orbiter Endeavour.7 

It took NASA 32 months after the Challenger accident to 
redesign and requalify the Solid Rocket Booster and to re-
turn the Shuttle to flight. The first post-accident flight was 
launched  on  September  29,  1988. As  the  Shuttle  returned 
to  flight,  NASA Associate Administrator  for  Space  Flight

Richard Truly  commented,  “We  will  always  have  to  treat 
it [the Shuttle] like an R&D test program, even many years 
into  the  future.  I  donʼt  think  calling  it  operational  fooled 
anybody within the program … It was a signal to the public 
that shouldnʼt have been sent.”8

The Shuttle Program After Return to Flight

After the Rogers Commission report was issued, NASA made 
many of the organizational changes the Commission recom-
mended. The space agency moved management of the Space 
Shuttle Program from the Johnson Space Center to NASA 
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The intent of this change 
was to create a management structure “resembling that of the 
Apollo program, with the aim of preventing communication 
deficiencies  that  contributed  to  the  Challenger  accident.”9 
NASA also established an Office of Safety, Reliability, and 
Quality Assurance at its Headquarters, though that office was 
not given the “direct authority” over all of NASAʼs safety 
operations  as  the  Rogers  Commission  had  recommended. 
Rather, NASA human space flight centers each retained their 
own safety organization reporting to the Center Director. 

In the almost 15 years between the return to flight and the 
loss  of  Columbia,  the  Shuttle  was  again  being  used  on  a 
regular basis to conduct space-based research, and, in line 
with  NASAʼs  original  1969  vision,  to  build  and  service 
a  space  station.  The  Shuttle  flew  87  missions  during  this 
period, compared to 24 before Challenger. Highlights from 
these  missions  include  the  1990  launch,  1993  repair,  and 
1999  and  2002  servicing  of  the  Hubble  Space Telescope; 
the launch of several major planetary probes; a number of 
Shuttle-Spacelab  missions  devoted  to  scientific  research; 
nine missions to rendezvous with the Russian space station 
Mir; the return of former Mercury astronaut Senator John 
Glenn to orbit in October 1998; and the launch of the first 
U.S. elements of the International Space Station. 

After  the  Challenger  accident,  the  Shuttle  was  no  longer 
described as “operational” in the same sense as commercial 
aircraft. Nevertheless, NASA continued planning as if the 
Shuttle could be readied for launch at or near whatever date 
was  set.  Tying  the  Shuttle  closely  to  International  Space 
Station needs, such as crew rotation, added to the urgency 
of maintaining a predictable launch schedule. The Shuttle 
is  currently  the  only  means  to  launch  the  already-built 
European,  Japanese,  and  remaining  U.S.  modules  needed 
to complete Station assembly and to carry and return most 
experiments and on-orbit supplies.10 Even after three occa-
sions  when  technical  problems  grounded  the  Shuttle  fleet 
for a month or more, NASA continued to assume that the 
Shuttle  could  regularly  and  predictably  service  the  Sta-
tion. In recent years, this coupling between the Station and 
Shuttle has become the primary driver of the Shuttle launch 
schedule. Whenever a Shuttle launch is delayed, it impacts 
Station assembly and operations.

In  September  2001,  testimony  on  the  Shuttleʼs  achieve-
ments during the preceding decade by NASAʼs then-Deputy 
Associate Administrator for Space Flight William Readdy 
indicated the assumptions under which NASA was operat-
ing during that period:

The Space Shuttle has made dramatic improvements in 
the  capabilities,  operations  and  safety  of  the  system. 
The payload-to-orbit performance of the Space Shuttle 
has been significantly improved – by over 70 percent to 
the Space Station. The safety of the Space Shuttle has 
also  been  dramatically  improved  by  reducing  risk  by 
more than a factor of five. In addition, the operability 
of the system has been significantly improved, with five 
minute launch windows – which would not have been 
attempted a decade ago – now becoming routine. This 
record  of  success  is  a  testament  to  the  quality  and 
dedication of the Space Shuttle management team and 
workforce, both civil servants and contractors.11 

5.2  THE NASA HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT CULTURE 

Though  NASA  underwent  many  management  reforms  in 
the  wake  of  the  Challenger  accident  and  appointed  new 
directors at the Johnson, Marshall, and Kennedy centers, the 
agencyʼs powerful human space flight culture remained in-
tact, as did many institutional practices, even if in a modified 
form. As a close observer of NASAʼs organizational culture 
has observed, “Cultural norms tend to be fairly resilient … 
The norms bounce back into shape after being stretched or 
bent. Beliefs held in common throughout the organization 
resist alteration.”12 This culture, as will become clear across 
the chapters of Part Two of this report, acted over time to re-
sist externally imposed change. By the eve of the Columbia 
accident, institutional practices that were in effect at the time 
of  the  Challenger  accident  –  such  as  inadequate  concern 
over deviations from expected performance, a silent safety 
program, and schedule pressure – had returned to NASA.

ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
Organizational  culture  refers  to  the  basic  values,  norms, 
beliefs, and practices that characterize the functioning of a 
particular institution. At the most basic level, organizational 
culture defines the assumptions that employees make as they 
carry out their work; it defines “the way we do things here.” 
An  organizationʼs  culture  is  a  powerful  force  that  persists 
through reorganizations and the departure of key personnel.

The human space flight culture within NASA originated in 
the Cold War environment. The space agency itself was cre-
ated in 1958 as a response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, 
the first artificial Earth satellite. In 1961, President John F. 
Kennedy  charged  the  new  space  agency  with  the  task  of 
reaching the moon before the end of the decade, and asked 
Congress and the American people to commit the immense 
resources for doing so, even though at the time NASA had 
only accumulated 15 minutes of human space flight experi-
ence. With its efforts linked to U.S.-Soviet competition for 
global leadership, there was a sense in the NASA workforce 
that the agency was engaged in a historic struggle central to 
the nationʼs agenda. 

The Apollo era created at NASA an exceptional “can-do” 
culture marked by tenacity in the face of seemingly impos-
sible challenges. This culture valued the interaction among

research and testing, hands-on engineering experience, and 
a dependence on the exceptional quality of the its workforce 
and leadership that provided in-house technical capability to 
oversee the work of contractors. The culture also accepted 
risk and failure as inevitable aspects of operating in space, 
even as it held as its highest value attention to detail in order 
to lower the chances of failure. 

The  dramatic Apollo  11  lunar  landing  in  July  1969  fixed 
NASAʼs  achievements  in  the  national  consciousness,  and 
in  history.  However,  the  numerous  accolades  in  the  wake 
of the moon landing also helped reinforce the NASA staffʼs 
faith in their organizational culture. Apollo successes created 
the powerful image of the space agency as a “perfect place,” 
as “the best organization that human beings could create to 
accomplish selected goals.”13 During Apollo, NASA was in 
many respects a highly successful organization capable of 
achieving seemingly impossible feats. The continuing image 
of NASA as a “perfect place” in the years after Apollo left 
NASA employees unable to recognize that NASA never had 
been, and still was not, perfect, nor was it as symbolically 
important in the continuing Cold War struggle as it had been 
for its first decade of existence. NASA personnel maintained 
a vision of their agency that was rooted in the glories of an 
earlier time, even as the world, and thus the context within 
which the space agency operated, changed around them.

As a result, NASAʼs human space flight culture never fully 
adapted to the Space Shuttle Program, with its goal of rou-
tine access to space rather than further exploration beyond 
low-Earth orbit. The Apollo-era organizational culture came 
to be in tension with the more bureaucratic space agency of 
the 1970s, whose focus turned from designing new space-
craft at any expense to repetitively flying a reusable vehicle 
on an ever-tightening budget. This trend toward bureaucracy 
and the associated increased reliance on contracting neces-
sitated more effective communications and more extensive 
safety oversight processes than had been in place during the 
Apollo era, but the Rogers Commission found that such fea-
tures were lacking.

In the aftermath of the Challenger accident, these contra-
dictory forces prompted a resistance to externally imposed 
changes and an attempt to maintain the internal belief that 
NASA  was  still  a  “perfect  place,”  alone  in  its  ability  to 
execute  a  program  of  human  space  flight.  Within  NASA 
centers, as Human Space Flight Program managers strove to 
maintain their view of the organization, they lost their ability 
to accept criticism, leading them to reject the recommenda-
tions  of  many  boards  and  blue-ribbon  panels,  the  Rogers 
Commission among them.

External criticism and doubt, rather than spurring NASA to 
change for the better, instead reinforced the will to “impose 
the party line vision on the environment, not to reconsider 
it,” according to one authority on organizational behavior. 
This in turn led to “flawed decision making, self deception, 
introversion  and  a  diminished  curiosity  about  the  world 
outside the perfect place.”14 The NASA human space flight 
culture the Board found during its investigation manifested 
many of these characteristics, in particular a self-confidence 
about  NASA  possessing  unique  knowledge  about  how  to 

safely launch people into space.15 As will be discussed later 
in this chapter, as well as in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, the Board 
views this cultural resistance as a fundamental impediment 
to NASAʼs effective organizational performance.
5.3  AN AGENCY TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH 

WITH TOO LITTLE 

A strong indicator of the priority the national political lead-
ership assigns to a federally funded activity is its budget. By 
that criterion, NASAʼs space activities have not been high 
on the list of national priorities over the past three decades 
(see Figure 5.3-1). After a peak during the Apollo program, 
when NASAʼs budget was almost four percent of the federal 
budget, NASAʼs budget since the early 1970s has hovered at 
one percent of federal spending or less.

Particularly  in  recent  years,  as  the  national  leadership  has 
confronted the challenging task of allocating scarce public 
resources  across  many  competing  demands,  NASA  has 
had difficulty obtaining a budget allocation adequate to its 
continuing ambitions. In 1990, the White House chartered a 
blue-ribbon committee chaired by aerospace executive Nor-
man Augustine to conduct a sweeping review of NASA and 
its programs in response to Shuttle problems and the flawed 
mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope.16 The review found 
that  NASAʼs  budget  was  inadequate  for  all  the  programs 
the agency was executing, saying that “NASA is currently 
over committed in terms of program obligations relative to 
resources available–in short, it is trying to do too much, and 
allowing too little margin for the unexpected.”17 “A reinvigo-
rated space program,” the Augustine committee went on to 
say, “will require real growth in the NASA budget of approx-
imately 10 percent per year (through the year 2000) reaching 
a peak spending level of about $30 billion per year (in con-
stant 1990 dollars) by about the year 2000.” Translated into 
the actual dollars of Fiscal Year 2000, that recommendation 
would have meant a NASA budget of over $40 billion; the 
actual NASA budget for that year was $13.6 billion.18

During the past decade, neither the White House nor Con-
gress has been interested in “a reinvigorated space program.” 
Instead, the goal has been a program that would continue to

produce valuable scientific and symbolic payoffs for the na-
tion without a need for increased budgets. Recent budget al-
locations reflect this continuing policy reality. Between 1993 
and 2002, the governmentʼs discretionary spending grew in 
purchasing power by more than 25 percent, defense spend-
ing by 15 percent, and non-defense spending by 40 percent 
(see Figure 5.3-2). NASAʼs budget, in comparison, showed 
little change, going from $14.31 billion in Fiscal Year 1993 
to a low of $13.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2000, and increas-
ing to $14.87 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. This represented a 
loss of 13 percent in purchasing power over the decade (see 
Figure 5.3-3).19

The  lack  of  top-level  interest  in  the  space  program  led  a 
2002  review  of  the  U.S.  aerospace  sector  to  observe  that 
“a  sense  of  lethargy  has  affected  the  space  industry  and 
community. Instead of the excitement and exuberance that 
dominated our early ventures into space, we at times seem 
almost  apologetic  about  our  continued  investments  in  the 
space program.”20

“Shuttle reliability is uncertain, but has been estimated to 
range between 97 and 99 percent. If the Shuttle reliability 
is 98 percent, there would be a 50-50 chance of losing an 
Orbiter within 34 flights … The probability of maintaining 
at least three Orbiters in the Shuttle fleet declines to less 
than 50 percent after flight 113.”21

-The Office of Technology Assessment, 1989

 

“And although it is a subject that meets with reluctance 
to  open  discussion,  and  has  therefore  too  often  been 
relegated  to  silence,  the  statistical  evidence  indicates 
that  we  are  likely  to  lose  another  Space  Shuttle  in  the 
next several years …  probably before the planned Space 
Station is completely established on orbit. This would seem 
to be the weak link of the civil space program – unpleasant 
to recognize, involving all the uncertainties of statistics, 
and difficult to resolve.”

-The Augustine Committee, 1990

Shuttle as Developmental Vehicle

“Shuttle  is  also  a  complex  system  that  has  yet  to 
demonstrate an ability to adhere to a fixed schedule” 

-The Augustine Committee, 1990

NASA Human Space Flight Culture

“NASA  has  not  been  sufficiently  responsive  to  valid 
criticism and the need for change.”22 

-The Augustine Committee, 1990

Faced with this budget situation, NASA had the choice of 
either eliminating major programs or achieving greater effi-
ciencies while maintaining its existing agenda. Agency lead-
ers chose to attempt the latter. They continued to develop 
the space station, continued robotic planetary and scientific 
missions, and continued Shuttle-based missions for both sci-
entific and symbolic purposes. In 1994 they took on the re-
sponsibility for developing an advanced technology launch 
vehicle in partnership with the private sector. They tried to 
do this by becoming more efficient. “Faster, better, cheaper” 
became the NASA slogan of the 1990s.23

The  flat  budget  at  NASA  particularly  affected  the  hu-
man space flight enterprise. During the decade before the 
Columbia accident, NASA rebalanced the share of its bud-
get allocated to human space flight from 48 percent of agen-
cy funding in Fiscal Year 1991 to 38 percent in Fiscal Year 
1999, with the remainder going mainly to other science and 
technology  efforts.  On  NASAʼs  fixed  budget,  that  meant

EARMARKS
Pressure  on  NASAʼs  budget  has  come  not  only  from  the 
White  House,  but  also  from  the  Congress.  In  recent  years 
there  has  been  an  increasing  tendency  for  the  Congress 
to  add  “earmarks”  –  congressional  additions  to  the  NASA 
budget request that reflect targeted Membersʼ interests. These 
earmarks come out of already-appropriated funds, reducing 
the amounts available for the original tasks. For example, as 
Congress considered NASAʼs Fiscal Year 2002 appropriation, 
the  NASA  Administrator  told  the  House  Appropriations 
subcommittee  with  jurisdiction  over  the  NASA  budget 
that  the  agency  was  “extremely  concerned  regarding  the 
magnitude  and  number  of  congressional  earmarks”  in  the 
House and Senate versions of the NASA appropriations bill.24 
He noted “the total number of House and Senate earmarks … 
is  approximately  140  separate  items,  an  increase  of  nearly 
50  percent  over  FY  2001.”  These  earmarks  reflected  “an 
increasing fraction of items that circumvent the peer review 
process, or involve construction or other objectives that have 
no  relation  to  NASA  mission  objectives.”  The  potential 
Fiscal Year 2002 earmarks represented “a net total of $540 
million in reductions to ongoing NASA programs to fund this 
extremely large number of earmarks.”25

the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station were 
competing  for  decreasing  resources.  In  addition,  at  least 
$650  million  of  NASAʼs  human  space  flight  budget  was 
used to purchase Russian hardware and services related to 
U.S.-Russian space cooperation. This initiative was largely 
driven by the Clinton Administrationʼs foreign policy and 
national  security  objectives  of  supporting  the  administra-

tion of Boris Yeltsin and halting the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and the means to deliver them.

Space Shuttle Program Budget Patterns

For the past 30 years, the Space Shuttle Program has been 
NASAʼs single most expensive activity, and of all NASAʼs 
efforts, that program has been hardest hit by the budget con-
straints of the past decade. Given the high priority assigned 
after 1993 to completing the costly International Space Sta-
tion, NASA managers have had little choice but to attempt 
to  reduce  the  costs  of  operating  the  Space  Shuttle.  This 
left  little  funding  for  Shuttle  improvements.  The  squeeze 
on the Shuttle budget was even more severe after the Of-
fice of Management and Budget in 1994 insisted that any 
cost overruns in the International Space Station budget be 
made up from within the budget allocation for human space 
flight, rather than from the agencyʼs budget as a whole. The 
Shuttle was the only other large program within that budget 
category.

Figures 5.3-4 and 5.3-5 show the trajectory of the Shuttle 
budget over the past decade. In Fiscal Year 1993, the out-
going Bush administration requested $4.128 billion for the 
Space Shuttle Program; five years later, the Clinton Admin-
istration request was for $2.977 billion, a 27 percent reduc-
tion. By Fiscal Year 2003, the budget request had increased 
to $3.208 billion, still a 22 percent reduction from a decade 
earlier. With inflation taken into account, over the past de-
cade, there has been a reduction of approximately 40 percent 
in the purchasing power of the programʼs budget, compared 
to a reduction of 13 percent in the NASA budget overall.

from 1991 to 2008. (Source: NASA Office of Space Flight)

This budget squeeze also came at a time when the Space 
Shuttle  Program  exhibited  a  trait  common  to  most  aging 
systems: increased costs due to greater maintenance require-
ments, a declining second- and third-tier contractor support 
base, and deteriorating infrastructure. Maintaining the Shut-
tle was becoming more expensive at a time when Shuttle 
budgets were decreasing or being held constant. Only in the 
last few years have those budgets begun a gradual increase.

As Figure 5.3-5 indicates, most of the steep reductions in 
the Shuttle budget date back to the first half of the 1990s. 
In the second half of the decade, the White House Office 
of Management and Budget and NASA Headquarters held 
the Shuttle budget relatively level by deferring substantial 
funding  for  Shuttle  upgrades  and  infrastructure  improve-
ments, while keeping pressure on NASA to limit increases 
in operating costs. 
5.4  TURBULENCE IN NASA HITS THE SPACE 

SHUTTLE PROGRAM

In  1992  the  White  House  replaced  NASA  Administrator 
Richard Truly with aerospace executive Daniel S. Goldin, 
a self-proclaimed “agent of change” who held office from 
April  1,  1992,  to  November  17,  2001  (in  the  process  be-
coming  the  longest-serving  NASA Administrator).  Seeing 
“space  exploration  (manned  and  unmanned)  as  NASAʼs 
principal  purpose  with  Mars  as  a  destiny,”  as  one  man-
agement  scholar  observed,  and  favoring  “administrative 
transformation” of NASA, Goldin engineered “not one or 
two policy changes, but a torrent of changes. This was not 
evolutionary change, but radical or discontinuous change.”26 
His tenure at NASA was one of continuous turmoil, to which 
the Space Shuttle Program was not immune.

Of course, turbulence does not necessarily degrade organi-
zational  performance.  In  some  cases,  it  accompanies  pro-
ductive change, and that is what Goldin hoped to achieve. 
He believed in the management approach advocated by W. 
Edwards  Deming,  who  had  developed  a  series  of  widely 
acclaimed  management  principles  based  on  his  work  in 
Japan during the “economic miracle” of the 1980s. Goldin

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET REDUCTIONS
In  most  years,  Congress  appropriates  slightly  less  for  the 
Space Shuttle Program than the President requested; in some 
cases, these reductions have been requested by NASA during 
the final stages of budget deliberations. After its budget was 
passed  by  Congress,  NASA  further  reduced  the  Shuttle 
budget  in  the  agencyʼs  operating  plan–the  plan  by  which 
NASA  actually  allocates  its  appropriated  budget  during 
the  fiscal  year  to  react  to  changing  program  needs.  These 
released funds were allocated to other activities, both within 
the  human  space  flight  program  and  in  other  parts  of  the 
agency. Changes in recent years include:

•  NASA transferred $190 million to International Space

Station (ISS). 

Fiscal Year 1998

•  At NASAʼs request, Congress transferred $50 million to 

ISS. 

•  NASA transferred $15 million to ISS.

Fiscal Year 1999

•  At NASAʼs request, Congress reduced Shuttle $31 mil-

lion so NASA could fund other requirements.

•  NASA  reduced  Shuttle  $32  million  by  deferring  two 

flights; funds transferred to ISS.

•  NASA added $2.3 million from ISS to previous NASA 

request.

Fiscal Year 2000

•  Congress added $25 million to Shuttle budget for up-
grades and transferred $25 million from operations to 
upgrades.

•  NASA reduced Shuttle $11.5 million per government-
wide rescission requirement and transferred $15.3 mil-
lion to ISS.

Fiscal Year 2001

•  At NASAʼs request, Congress reduced Shuttle budget by 

$40 million to fund Mars initiative.

•  NASA reduced Shuttle $6.9 million per rescission re-

quirement.

Fiscal Year 2002

•  Congress reduced Shuttle budget $50 million to reflect 
cancellation of electric Auxiliary Power Unit and added 
$20  million  for  Shuttle  upgrades  and  $25  million  for 
Vehicle Assembly Building repairs.

•  NASA transferred $7.6 million to fund Headquarters re-
quirements and cut $1.2 million per rescission require-
ment.

and  sometimes  counterproductive,  and  those  carrying  out 
the work should bear primary responsibility for its quality. 
It is arguable whether these business principles can readily 
be  applied  to  a  government  agency  operating  under  civil 
service rules and in a politicized environment. Nevertheless, 
Goldin sought to implement them throughout his tenure.27

Space Shuttle Program and thereby free up those skills for 
finishing the space station and beginning work on his pre-
ferred  objective–human  exploration  of  Mars.  Such  a  shift 
would return NASA to its exploratory mission. He was often 
at odds with those who continued to focus on the centrality 
of the Shuttle to NASAʼs future.

Goldin made many positive changes in his decade at NASA. 
By  bringing  Russia  into  the  Space  Station  partnership  in 
1993,  Goldin  developed  a  new  post-Cold  War  rationale 
for the agency while managing to save a program that was 
politically faltering. The International Space Station became 
NASAʼs premier program, with the Shuttle serving in a sup-
porting role. Goldin was also instrumental in gaining accep-
tance of the “faster, better, cheaper”28 approach to the plan-
ning of robotic missions and downsizing “an agency that was 
considered bloated and bureaucratic when he took it over.”29 

Goldin described himself as “sharp-edged” and could often 
be blunt. He rejected the criticism that he was sacrificing 
safety in the name of efficiency. In 1994 he told an audience 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “When I ask for the budget 
to be cut, Iʼm told itʼs going to impact safety on the Space 
Shuttle … I think thatʼs a bunch of crap.”30 

One  of  Goldinʼs  high-priority  objectives  was  to  decrease 
involvement of the NASA engineering workforce with the 

Initial Shuttle Workforce Reductions

With NASA leadership choosing to maintain existing pro-
grams within a no-growth budget, Goldinʼs “faster, better, 
cheaper” motto became the agencyʼs slogan of the 1990s.31 
NASA  leaders,  however,  had  little  maneuvering  room  in 
which  to  achieve  efficiency  gains.  Attempts  by  NASA 
Headquarters to shift functions or to close one of the three 
human space flight centers were met with strong resistance 
from the Centers themselves, the aerospace firms they used 
as  contractors,  and  the  congressional  delegations  of  the 
states in which the Centers were located. This alliance re-
sembles the classic “iron triangle” of bureaucratic politics, 
a conservative coalition of bureaucrats, interest groups, and 
congressional subcommittees working together to promote 
their common interests.32

With  Center  infrastructure  off-limits,  this  left  the  Space 
Shuttle  budget  as  an  obvious  target  for  cuts.  Because  the 
Shuttle  required  a  large  “standing  army”  of  workers  to

keep  it  flying,  reducing  the  size  of  the  Shuttle  workforce 
became the primary means by which top leaders lowered the 
Shuttleʼs operating costs. These personnel reduction efforts 
started early in the decade and continued through most of 
the 1990s. They created substantial uncertainty and tension 
within the Shuttle workforce, as well as the transitional diffi-
culties inherent in any large-scale workforce reassignment. 

In early 1991, even before Goldin assumed office and less 
than three years after the Shuttle had returned to flight after 
the Challenger accident, NASA announced a goal of saving 
three to five percent per year in the Shuttle budget over five 
years. This  move  was  in  reaction to  a  perception that  the 
agency had overreacted to the Rogers Commission recom-
mendations – for example, the notion that the many layers of 
safety inspections involved in preparing a Shuttle for flight 
had created a bloated and costly safety program. 

From 1991 to 1994, NASA was able to cut Shuttle operating 
costs by 21 percent. Contractor personnel working on the 
Shuttle declined from 28,394 to 22,387 in these three years, 
and  NASA  Shuttle  staff  decreased  from  4,031  to  2,959.33 
Figure 5.4-1 shows the changes in Space Shuttle workforce 
over the past decade. A 1994 National Academy of Public 
Administration review found that these cuts were achieved 
primarily through “operational and organizational efficien-
cies and consolidations, with resultant reductions in staffing 
levels and other actions which do not significantly impact 
basic program content or capabilities.”34

NASA considered additional staff cuts in late 1994 and early 
1995 as a way of further reducing the Space Shuttle Program 
budget. In early 1995, as the national leadership focused its 
attention  on  balancing  the  federal  budget,  the  projected 
five-year Shuttle budget requirements exceeded by $2.5 bil-
lion the budget that was likely to be approved by the White 
House Office of Management and Budget.35 Despite its al-
ready significant progress in reducing costs, NASA had to 
make further workforce cuts.

Anticipating  this  impending  need,  a  1994-1995  NASA 
“Functional  Workforce  Review”  concluded  that  removing 
an additional 5,900 people from the NASA and contractor 
Shuttle workforce – just under 13 percent of the total – could 
be  done  without  compromising  safety.36  These  personnel 
cuts were made in Fiscal Years 1996 and 1997. By the end 
of  1997,  the  NASA  Shuttle  civilian  workforce  numbered 
2,195, and the contractor workforce 17,281.

Shifting Shuttle Management Arrangements

Workforce reductions were not the only modifications to the 
Shuttle Program in the middle of the decade. In keeping with 
Goldinʼs philosophy that Headquarters should concern itself 
primarily  with  strategic  issues,  in  February  1996  Johnson 
Space Center was designated as “lead center” for the Space 
Shuttle Program, a role it held prior to the Challenger ac-
cident. This shift was part of a general move of all program 
management  responsibilities  from  NASA  Headquarters  to 
the agencyʼs field centers. Among other things, this change 
meant that Johnson Space Center managers would have au-
thority over the funding and management of Shuttle activi-

ties at the Marshall and Kennedy Centers. Johnson and Mar-
shall had been rivals since the days of Apollo, and long-term 
Marshall employees and managers did not easily accept the 
return of Johnson to this lead role. 

The shift of Space Shuttle Program management to Johnson 
was worrisome to some. The head of the Space Shuttle Pro-
gram at NASA Headquarters, Bryan OʼConnor, argued that 
transfer of the management function to the Johnson Space 
Center would return the Shuttle Program management to the 
flawed structure that was in place before the Challenger ac-
cident. “It is a safety issue,” he said, “we ran it that way [with 
program management at Headquarters, as recommended by 
the Rogers Commission] for 10 years without a mishap and 
I didnʼt see any reason why we should go back to the way 
we  operated  in  the  pre-Challenger  days.”37  Goldin  gave 
OʼConnor  several  opportunities  to  present  his  arguments 
against  a  transfer  of  management  responsibility,  but  ulti-
mately decided to proceed. OʼConnor felt he had no choice 
but to resign.38 (OʼConnor returned to NASA in 2002 as As-
sociate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance.)

In January 1996, Goldin appointed as Johnsonʼs director his 
close advisor, George W.S. Abbey. Abbey, a space program 
veteran, was a firm believer in the values of the original hu-
man space flight culture, and as he assumed the directorship, 
he set about recreating as many of the positive features of 
that culture as possible. For example, he and Goldin initiat-
ed, as a way for young engineers to get hands-on experience, 
an in-house X-38 development program as a prototype for 
a space station crew rescue vehicle. Abbey was a powerful 
leader, who through the rest of the decade exerted substan-
tial control over all aspects of Johnson Space Center opera-
tions, including the Space Shuttle Program.

Space Flight Operations Contract

By the middle of the decade, spurred on by Vice President Al 
Goreʼs “reinventing government” initiative, the goal of bal-
ancing the federal budget, and the views of a Republican-led 
House of Representatives, managers throughout the govern-
ment sought new ways of making public sector programs 
more efficient and less costly. One method considered was 
transferring significant government operations and respon-
sibilities to the private sector, or “privatization.” NASA led 
the way toward privatization, serving as an example to other 
government agencies.

In keeping with his philosophy that NASA should focus on 
its research-and-development role, Goldin wanted to remove 
NASA  employees  from  the  repetitive  operations  of  vari-
ous  systems,  including  the  Space  Shuttle.  Giving  primary 
responsibility  for  Space  Shuttle  operations  to  the  private 
sector  was  therefore  consistent  with  White  House  and 
congressional priorities and attractive to Goldin on its own 
terms. Beginning in 1994, NASA considered the feasibility 
of consolidating many of the numerous Shuttle operations 
contracts under a single prime contractor. At that time, the 
Space Shuttle Program was managing 86 separate contracts 
held by 56 different firms. Top NASA managers thought that 
consolidating  these  contracts  could  reduce  the  amount  of 
redundant overhead, both for NASA and for the contractors

themselves. They also wanted to explore whether there were 
functions being carried out by NASA that could be more ef-
fectively and inexpensively carried out by the private sector.

An advisory committee headed by early space flight veteran 
Christopher  Kraft  recommended  such  a  step  in  its  March 
1995 report, which became known as the “Kraft Report.”39 
(The report characterized the Space Shuttle in a way that the 
Board judges to be at odds with the realities of the Shuttle 
Program).

The report made the following findings and recommenda-
tions:

•  “The Shuttle has become a mature and reliable system 

… about as safe as todayʼs technology will provide.”

•  “Given the maturity of the vehicle, a change to a new 
mode  of  management  with  considerably  less  NASA 
oversight is possible at this time.”

•  “Many  inefficiencies  and  difficulties  in  the  current 
Shuttle  Program  can  be  attributed  to  the  diffuse  and 
fragmented NASA and contractor structure. Numerous 
contractors exist supporting various program elements, 
resulting in ambiguous lines of communication and dif-
fused responsibilities.”

•  NASA should “consolidate operations under a single-

business entity.”

•  “The  program  remains  in  a  quasi-development  mode 
and  yearly  costs  remain  higher  than  required,”  and 
NASA should “freeze the current vehicle configuration, 
minimizing  future  modifications,  with  such  modifica-
tions delivered in block updates. Future block updates 
should implement modifications required to make the 
vehicle more re-usable and operational.”

•  NASA  should  “restructure  and  reduce  the  overall 
Safety,  Reliability,  and  Quality  Assurance  elements 
– without reducing safety.”40

When he released his committeeʼs report, Kraft said that “if 
NASA wants to make more substantive gains in terms of ef-
ficiency, cost savings and better service to its customers, we 
think itʼs imperative they act on these recommendations … 
And we believe that these savings are real, achievable, and 
can be accomplished with no impact to the safe and success-
ful operation of the Shuttle system.”41

Although the Kraft Report stressed that the dramatic changes 
it recommended could be made without compromising safe-
ty, there was considerable dissent about this claim. NASAʼs 
Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel – independent, but often 
not very influential – was particularly critical. In May 1995, 
the Panel noted that “the assumption [in the Kraft Report] 
that the Space Shuttle systems are now ʻmatureʼ smacks of 
a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps. The fact 
is that the Space Shuttle may never be mature enough to to-
tally freeze the design.” The Panel also noted that “the report 
dismisses the concerns of many credible sources by labeling 
honest reservations and the people who have made them as 
being  partners  in  an  unneeded  ʻsafety  shieldʼ  conspiracy. 
Since only one more accident would kill the program and 
destroy far more than the spacecraft, it is extremely callous” 
to make such an accusation.42 

The notion that NASA would further reduce the number of 
civil  servants  working  on  the  Shuttle  Program  prompted 
senior Kennedy Space Center engineer José Garcia to send 
to President Bill Clinton on August 25, 1995, a letter that 
stated, “The biggest threat to the safety of the crew since 
the  Challenger  disaster  is  presently  underway  at  NASA.” 
Garciaʼs particular concern was NASAʼs “efforts to delete 
the ʻchecks and balancesʼ system of processing Shuttles as a 
way of saving money … Historically NASA has employed 
two engineering teams at KSC, one contractor and one gov-
ernment, to cross check each other and prevent catastrophic 
errors … although this technique is expensive, it is effec-
tive, and it is the single most important factor that sets the 
Shuttleʼs success above that of any other launch vehicle … 
Anyone who doesnʼt have a hidden agenda or fear of losing 
his job would admit that you canʼt delete NASAʼs checks 
and balances system of Shuttle processing without affecting 
the safety of the Shuttle and crew.”43

NASA leaders accepted the advice of the Kraft Report and 
in August 1995 solicited industry bids for the assignment of 
Shuttle prime contractor. In response, Lockheed Martin and 
Rockwell, the two major Space Shuttle operations contrac-
tors, formed a limited liability corporation, with each firm a 
50 percent owner, to compete for what was called the Space 
Flight Operations Contract. The new corporation would be 
known as United Space Alliance. 

In November 1995, NASA awarded the operations contract 
to  United  Space  Alliance  on  a  sole  source  basis.  (When 
Boeing  bought  Rockwellʼs  aerospace  group  in  December 
1996, it also took over Rockwellʼs 50 percent ownership of 
United Space Alliance.) The company was responsible for 
61 percent of the Shuttle operations contracts. Some in Con-
gress were skeptical that safety could be maintained under 
the new arrangement, which transferred significant NASA 
responsibilities to the private sector. Despite these concerns, 
Congress  ultimately  accepted  the  reasoning  behind  the 
contract.44 NASA then spent much of 1996 negotiating the 
contractʼs terms and conditions with United Space Alliance.

The Space Flight Operations Contract was designed to reward 
United Space Alliance for performance successes and penal-
ize  its  performance  failures.  Before  being  eligible  for  any 
performance fees, United Space Alliance would have to meet 
a series of safety “gates,” which were intended to ensure that 
safety remained the top priority in Shuttle operations. The 
contract also rewarded any cost reductions that United Space 
Alliance was able to achieve, with NASA taking 65 percent 
of any savings and United Space Alliance 35 percent.45 

NASA  and  United  Space  Alliance  formally  signed  the 
Space Flight Operations Contract on October 1, 1996. Ini-
tially, only the major Lockheed Martin and Rockwell Shuttle 
contracts and a smaller Allied Signal Unisys contract were 
transferred to United Space Alliance. The initial contractual 
period was six years, from October 1996 to September 2002. 
NASA exercised an option for a two-year extension in 2002, 
and another two-year option exists. The total value of the 
contract through the current extension is estimated at $12.8 
billion. United Space Alliance currently has approximately 
10,000 employees.

SPACE FLIGHT OPERATIONS CONTRACT

The Space Flight Operations Contract has two major areas 
of innovation:

•  It replaced the previous “cost-plus” contracts (in which a 
firm was paid for the costs of its activity plus a negotiat-
ed profit) with a complex contract structure that included 
performance-based and cost reduction incentives. Per-
formance  measures  include  safety,  launch  readiness, 
on-time launch, Solid Rocket Booster recovery, proper 
orbital insertion, and successful landing.

•  It gave additional responsibilities for Shuttle operation, 
including  safety  and  other  inspections  and  integration 
of the various elements of the Shuttle system, to United 
Space Alliance. Many of those responsibilities were pre-
viously within the purview of NASA employees.

Under the Space Flight Operations Contract, United Space 
Alliance  had  overall  responsibility  for  processing  selected 
Shuttle hardware, including: 

•  Inspecting and modifying the Orbiters
•  Installing the Space Shuttle Main Engines on the Orbit-

•  Assembling the sections that make up the Solid Rocket 

ers

Boosters 

•  Attaching the External Tank to the Solid Rocket Boost-

ers, and then the Orbiter to the External Tank
•  Recovering expended Solid Rocket boosters

and 

recovery 

In  addition  to  processing  Shuttle  hardware,  United  Space 
Alliance  is  responsible  for  mission  design  and  planning, 
astronaut and flight controller training, design and integration 
of  flight  software,  payload  integration,  flight  operations, 
launch 
vehicle-sustaining 
engineering, flight crew equipment processing, and operation 
and  maintenance  of  Shuttle-specific  facilities  such  as 
the  Vehicle  Assembly  Building,  the  Orbiter  Processing 
Facility,  and  the  launch  pads.  United  Space  Alliance  also 
provides  spare  parts  for  the  Orbiters,  maintains  Shuttle 
flight simulators, and provides tools and supplies, including 
consumables such as food, for Shuttle missions. 

operations, 

Under the Space Flight Operations Contract, NASA has the 
following responsibilities and roles: 

•  Maintaining ownership of the Shuttles and all other as-

sets of the Shuttle program

•  Providing  to  United  Space Alliance  the  Space  Shuttle 
Main Engines, the External Tanks, and the Redesigned 
Solid  Rocket  Motor  segments  for  assembly  into  the 
Solid Rocket Boosters

•  Managing the overall process of ensuring Shuttle safety
•  Developing requirements for major upgrades to all as-

•  Participating  in  the  planning  of  Shuttle  missions,  the 

directing of launches, and the execution of flights

•  Performing surveillance and audits and obtaining tech-

nical insight into contractor activities

•  Deciding if and when to “commit to flight” for each mis-

sets

sion46

The contract provided for additional consolidation and then 
privatization, when all remaining Shuttle operations would 
be  transferred  from  NASA.  Phase  2,  scheduled  for  1998-
2000, called for the transfer of Johnson Space Center-man-
aged  flight  software  and  flight  crew  equipment  contracts 
and  the  Marshall  Space  Center-managed  contracts  for  the 
External Tank, Space Shuttle Main Engine, Reusable Solid 
Rocket Motor, and Solid Rocket Booster.

However, Marshall and its contractors, with the concurrence 
of the Space Shuttle Program Office at Johnson Space Cen-
ter, successfully resisted the transfer of its contracts. There-
fore, the Space Flight Operations Contractʼs initial efficiency 
and integrated management goals have not been achieved. 

The major annual savings resulting from the Space Flight 
Operations Contract, which in 1996 were touted to be some 
$500  million  to  $1  billion  per  year  by  the  early  2000s, 
have  not  materialized. These  projections  assumed  that  by 
2002,  NASA  would  have  put  all  Shuttle  contracts  under 
the auspices of United Space Alliance, and would be mov-
ing toward Shuttle privatization. Although the Space Flight 
Operations Contract has not been as successful in achiev-
ing cost efficiencies as its proponents hoped, it has reduced 
some  Shuttle  operating  costs  and  other  expenses.  By  one 
estimate, in its first six years the contract has saved NASA a 
total of more than $1 billion.47

Privatizing the Space Shuttle

To its proponents, the Space Flight Operations Contract was 
only a beginning. In October 1997, United Space Alliance 
submitted  to  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  Office  a  contrac-
tually  required  plan  for  privatizing  the  Shuttle,  which  the 
program did not accept. But the notion of Shuttle privatiza-
tion lingered at NASA Headquarters and in Congress, where 
some members advocated a greater private sector role in the 
space program. Congress passed the Commercial Space Act 
of 1998, which directed the NASA Administrator to “plan for 
the eventual privatization of the Space Shuttle Program.”48 

By August  2001,  NASA  Headquarters  prepared  for White 
House consideration a “Privatization White Paper” that called 
for transferring all Shuttle hardware, pilot and commander 
astronauts, and launch and operations teams to a private op-
erator.49 In September 2001, Space Shuttle Program Manager 
Ron Dittemore released his report on a “Concept of Priva-
tization of the Space Shuttle Program,”50 which argued that 
for the Space Shuttle “to remain safe and viable, it is neces-
sary to merge the required NASA and contractor skill bases” 
into a single private organization that would manage human 
space flight. This perspective reflected Dittemoreʼs belief that 
the split of responsibilities between NASA and United Space 
Alliance was not optimal, and that it was unlikely that NASA 
would ever recapture the Shuttle responsibilities that were 
transferred in the Space Flight Operations Contract. 

Dittemoreʼs  plan  recommended  transferring  700  to  900 
NASA employees to the private organization, including:

•  Astronauts, including the flight crew members who op-

erate the Shuttle

After such a shift occurred, according to the Dittemore plan, 
“the primary role for NASA in Space Shuttle operations … 
will be to provide an SMA [Safety and Mission Assurance] 
independent assessment … utilizing audit and surveillance 
techniques.”51 

With a change in NASA Administrators at the end of 2001 
and the new Bush Administrationʼs emphasis on “competitive 
sourcing” of government operations, the notion of wholesale 
privatization of the Space Shuttle was replaced with an ex-
amination of the feasibility of both public- and private-sector 
Program management. This competitive sourcing was under 
examination at the time of the Columbia accident. 

Workforce Transformation and the End of 
Downsizing

Workforce reductions instituted by Administrator Goldin as 
he attempted to redefine the agencyʼs mission and its overall 
organization also added to the turbulence of his reign. In the 
1990s, the overall NASA workforce was reduced by 25 per-
cent through normal attrition, early retirements, and buyouts 
– cash bonuses for leaving NASA employment. NASA op-
erated under a hiring freeze for most of the decade, making 
it difficult to bring in new or younger people. Figure 5.4-2 
shows the downsizing of the overall NASA workforce dur-
ing this period as well as the associated shrinkage in NASAʼs 
technical workforce. 

NASA Headquarters was particularly affected by workforce 
reductions. More than half its employees left or were trans-
ferred in parallel with the 1996 transfer of program manage-
ment responsibilities back to the NASA centers. The Space 
Shuttle Program bore more than its share of Headquarters 
personnel cuts. Headquarters civil service staff working on 
the Space Shuttle Program went from 120 in 1993 to 12 in 
2003. 

While the overall workforce at the NASA Centers involved 
in  human  space  flight  was  not  as  radically  reduced,  the 
combination  of  the  general  workforce  reduction  and  the 
introduction  of  the  Space  Flight  Operations  Contract  sig-
nificantly impacted the Centersʼ Space Shuttle Program civil 
service staff. Johnson Space Center went from 1,330 in 1993 
to 738 in 2002; Marshall Space Flight Center, from 874 to 
337; and Kennedy Space Center from 1,373 to 615. Ken-
nedy Director Roy Bridges argued that personnel cuts were 
too deep, and threatened to resign unless the downsizing of 
his civil service workforce, particularly those involved with 
safety issues, was reversed.52 

By the end of the decade, NASA realized that staff reduc-
tions had gone too far. By early 2000, internal and external

studies convinced NASA leaders that the workforce needed 
to  be  revitalized.  These  studies  noted  that  “five  years  of 
buyouts  and  downsizing  have  led  to  serious  skill  imbal-
ances and an overtaxed core workforce. As more employees 
have departed, the workload and stress [on those] remain-
ing  have  increased,  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  the 
potential for impacts to operational capacity and safety.” 53
NASA announced that NASA workforce downsizing would 
stop short of the 17,500 target, and that its human space flight 
centers would immediately hire several hundred workers. 
5.5  WHEN TO REPLACE THE SPACE SHUTTLE?

In addition to budget pressures, workforce reductions, man-
agement changes, and the transfer of government functions 
to the private sector, the Space Shuttle Program was beset 
during the past decade by uncertainty about when the Shuttle 
might be replaced. National policy has vacillated between 
treating  the  Shuttle  as  a  “going  out  of  business”  program 
and anticipating two or more decades of Shuttle use. As a 
result, limited and inconsistent investments have been made 
in Shuttle upgrades and in revitalizing the infrastructure to 
support the continued use of the Shuttle.

Even before the 1986 Challenger accident, when and how 
to replace the Space Shuttle with a second generation reus-
able launch vehicle was a topic of discussion among space 
policy leaders. In January 1986, the congressionally char-
tered  National  Commission  on  Space  expressed  the  need 
for  a  Shuttle  replacement,  suggesting  that  “the  Shuttle 
fleet will become obsolescent by the turn of the century.”54 
Shortly after the Challenger accident (but not as a reaction 
to it), President Reagan announced his approval of “the new 
Orient  Express”  (see  Figure  5.5-1).  This  reusable  launch 
vehicle,  later  known  as  the  National  Aerospace  Plane, 
“could, by the end of the decade, take off from Dulles Air-
port, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound attaining 
low-Earth orbit, or fly to Tokyo within two hours.”55 This 
goal proved too ambitious, particularly without substantial

funding.  In  1992,  after  a  $1.7  billion  government  invest-
ment, the National Aerospace Plane project was cancelled.

This  pattern  –  optimistic  pronouncements  about  a  revolu-
tionary  Shuttle  replacement  followed  by  insufficient  gov-
ernment investment, and then program cancellation due to 
technical difficulties – was repeated again in the 1990s. 

Figure 5.5-1. A 1986 artistʼs conception of the National Aerospace 
Plane on a mission to the Space Station.

In  1994,  NASA  listed  alternatives  for  access  to  space 
through 2030.

2030

•  Upgrade  the  Space  Shuttle  to  enable  flights  through 

•  Develop a new expendable launcher
•  Replace the Space Shuttle with a “leapfrog” next-gen-
eration advanced technology system that would achieve 
order-of-magnitude improvements in the cost effective-
ness of space transportation.56

Figure 5.5-2. The VentureStar was intended to replace the Space 
Shuttle based on technology developed for the X-33.

Reflecting  its  leadershipʼs  preference  for  bold  initiatives, 
NASA chose the third alternative. With White House sup-
port,57 NASA began the X-33 project in 1996 as a joint effort 
with Lockheed Martin. NASA also initiated the less ambi-
tious X-34 project with Orbital Sciences Corporation. At the 
time, the future of commercial space launches was bright, 
and  political  sentiment  in  the White  House  and  Congress 
encouraged  an  increasing  reliance  on  private-sector  solu-
tions for limiting government expenditures. In this context, 
these unprecedented joint projects appeared less risky than 
they actually were. The hope was that NASA could replace 
the Shuttle through private investments, without significant 
government spending.

Both  the  X-33  and  X-34  incorporated  new  technologies. 
The X-33 was to demonstrate the feasibility of an aerospike 
engine,  new  Thermal  Protection  Systems,  and  composite 
rather than metal propellant tanks. These radically new tech-
nologies were in turn to become the basis for a new orbital 
vehicle  called VentureStar™  that  could  replace  the  Space 
Shuttle by 2006 (see Figure 5.5-2). The X-33 and X-34 ran 
into technical problems and never flew. In 2001, after spend-
ing $1.3 billion, NASA abandoned both projects.

In all three projects – National Aerospace Plane, X-33, and 
X-34 – national leaders had set ambitious goals in response 
to NASAʼs ambitious proposals. These programs relied on 
the  invention  of  revolutionary  technology,  had  run  into 
major  technical  problems,  and  had  been  denied  the  funds 
needed to overcome these problems – assuming they could 
be  solved.  NASA  had  spent  nearly  15  years  and  several 
billion  dollars,  and  yet  had  made  no  meaningful  progress 
toward a Space Shuttle replacement.

In  2000,  as  the  agency  ran  into  increasing  problems  with 
the  X-33,  NASA  initiated  the  Space  Launch  Initiative,  a 
$4.5 billion multi-year effort to develop new space launch 
technologies. By 2002, after spending nearly $800 million, 
NASA again changed course. The Space Launch Initiative 
failed  to  find  technologies  that  could  revolutionize  space 
launch, forcing NASA to shift its focus to an Orbital Space 
Plane, developed with existing technology, that would com-
plement the Shuttle by carrying crew, but not cargo, to and 
from  orbit.  Under  a  new  Integrated  Space  Transportation 
Plan, the Shuttle might continue to fly until 2020 or beyond. 
(See Section 5.6 for a discussion of this plan.)

As a result of the haphazard policy process that created these 
still-born  developmental  programs,  the  uncertainty  over 
Shuttle replacement persisted. Between 1986 and 2002, the 
planned replacement date for the Space Shuttle was consis-
tent only in its inconsistency: it changed from 2002 to 2006 
to 2012, and before the Columbia accident, to 2020 or later.

Safety Concerns and Upgrading the Space Shuttle

This shifting date for Shuttle replacement has severely com-
plicated decisions on how to invest in Shuttle Program up-
grades. More often than not, investments in upgrades were 
delayed or deferred on the assumption they would be a waste 
of money if the Shuttle were to be retired in the near future 
(see Figure 5.5-3).

PAST REPORTS REVIEWED

During the course of the investigation, more than 50 past reports regarding NASA and the Space Shuttle Program were reviewed. The 
principal purpose of these reviews was to note what factors that reports examined, what findings were made, and what response, if any, 
NASA may have made to the findings. Board members then used these findings and responses as a benchmark during their investigation to 
compare to NASAʼs current programs.  In addition to an extensive 300-page examination of every Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel report 
(see Appendix D.18), the reports listed on the accompanying chart were examined for specific factors related to the investigation.  A complete 
listing of those past reportsʼ findings, plus the full text of the reports, is contained in Appendix D.18.

(Source: NASA)

In 1995, for instance, the Kraft Report embraced the prin-
ciple that NASA should “freeze the design” of the Shuttle 
and  defer  upgrades  due  to  the  vehicleʼs  “mature”  status 
and the need for NASA to “concentrate scarce resources on 
developing potential replacements for the Shuttle.”58 NASA 
subsequently  halted  a  number  of  planned  upgrades,  only 
to  reverse  course  a  year  later  to  “take  advantage  of  tech-
nologies to improve Shuttle safety and the need for a robust 
Space Shuttle to assemble the ISS.”59

In a June 1999 letter to the White House, NASA Adminis-
trator Daniel Goldin declared that the nation faced a “Space 
Launch Crisis.” He reported on a NASA review of Shuttle 
safety that indicated the budget for Shuttle upgrades in Fiscal 
year 2000 was “inadequate to accommodate upgrades neces-
sary to yield significant safety improvements.”60 After two 
“close calls” during STS-93 in July 1999 Goldin also char-
tered a Shuttle Independent Assessment Team (SIAT) chaired 
by Harry McDonald, Director of NASA Ames Research Cen-
ter. Among the teamʼs findings, reported in March 2000:61

•  “Over the course of the Shuttle Program … processes, 
procedures  and  training  have  continuously  been  im-
proved and implemented to make the system safer. The 
SIAT has a major concern … that this critical feature of 
the Shuttle Program is being eroded.” The major factor 
leading  to  this  concern  “is  the  reduction  in  allocated 
resources and appropriate staff … There are important 
technical areas that are ʻone-deep.ʼ ” Also, “the SIAT 
feels  strongly  that  workforce  augmentation  must  be 
realized principally with NASA personnel rather than 
with contractor personnel.”

•  The  SIAT  was  concerned  with  “success-engendered 
safety  optimism  …  The  SSP  must  rigorously  guard 
against  the  tendency  to  accept  risk  solely  because  of 
prior success.”

•  “The SIAT was very concerned with what it perceived as 
Risk Management process erosion created by the desire 
to reduce costs … The SIAT feels strongly that NASA 
Safety and Mission Assurance should be restored to its 
previous role of an independent oversight body, and not 
be simply a ʻsafety auditor.ʼ ”

•  “The size and complexity of the Shuttle system and of 
NASA/contractor  relationships  place  extreme  impor-
tance on understanding, communication, and informa-
tion handling … Communication of problems and con-
cerns upward to the SSP from the ʻfloorʼ also appeared 
to leave room for improvement.”62

The Shuttle Independent Assessment Team report also stated 
that the Shuttle “clearly cannot be thought of as ʻoperationalʼ 
in the usual sense. Extensive maintenance, major amounts 
of ʻtouch laborʼ and a high degree of skill and expertise will 
always be required.” However, “the workforce has received 
a conflicting message due to the emphasis on achieving cost 
and staff reductions, and the pressures placed on increasing 
scheduled flights as a result of the Space Station.”63

Responding  to  NASAʼs  concern  that  the  Shuttle  required 
safety-related  upgrades,  the  Presidentʼs  proposed  NASA 
budget  for  Fiscal Year  2001  proposed  a  “safety  upgrades 
initiative.” That initiative had a short life span. In its Fiscal 
Year 2002 budget request, NASA proposed to spend $1.836 
billion on Shuttle upgrades over five years. A year later, the 
Fiscal Year 2003 request contained a plan to spend $1.220 
billion – a 34 percent reduction. The reductions were pri-
marily a response to rising Shuttle operating costs and the 
need to stay within a fixed Shuttle budget. Cost growth in 
Shuttle operations forced NASA to “use funds intended for 
Space Shuttle safety upgrades to address operational, sup-
portability, obsolescence, and infrastructure needs.” 64 

At its March 2001 meeting, NASAʼs Space Flight Advisory 
Committee advised that “the Space Shuttle Program must 
make larger, more substantial safety upgrades than currently 
planned … a budget on the order of three times the budget 
currently  allotted  for  improving  the  Shuttle  systems”  was 
needed.65 Later that year, five Senators complained that “the 
Shuttle program is being penalized, despite its outstanding 
performance, in order to conform to a budget strategy that 
is dangerously inadequate to ensure safety in Americaʼs hu-
man space flight program.”66 (See Chapter 7 for additional 
discussion of Shuttle safety upgrades.)

Deteriorating Shuttle Infrastructure

The same ambiguity about investing in Shuttle upgrades has 
also  affected  the  maintenance  of  Shuttle  Program  ground 
infrastructure, much of which dates to Project Apollo and 
1970s Shuttle Program construction. Figure 5.5-4 depicts the 
age of the Shuttleʼs infrastructure as of 2000. Most ground 
infrastructure was not built for such a protracted lifespan. 
Maintaining infrastructure has been particularly difficult at 
Kennedy Space Center, where it is constantly exposed to a 
salt water environment.

Board investigators have identified deteriorating infrastruc-
ture  associated  with  the  launch  pads,  Vehicle  Assembly 
Building, and the crawler transporter. Figures 5.5-5 and 5.5-6
depict some of this deterioration. For example, NASA has 
installed nets, and even an entire sub-roof, inside the Vehicle 
Assembly Building to prevent concrete from the buildingʼs 
ceiling from hitting the Orbiter and Shuttle stack. In addi-
tion, the corrosion-control challenge results in zinc primer

on certain launch pad areas being exposed to the elements. 
When rain falls on these areas, it carries away zinc, runs onto 
the leading edge of the Orbiterʼs wings, and causes pinholes 
in the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon panels (see Chapter 3).

In  2000,  NASA  identified  100  infrastructure  items  that 
demanded  immediate  attention.  NASA  briefed  the  Space 
Flight Advisory Committee on this “Infrastructure Revital-
ization” initiative in November of that year. The Committee 
concluded  that  “deteriorating  infrastructure  is  a  serious, 
major problem,” and, upon touring several Kennedy Space 
Center facilities, declared them “in deplorable condition.”67  
NASA subsequently submitted a request to the White House 
Office of Management and Budget during Fiscal Year 2002 
budget deliberations for $600 million to fund the infrastruc-
ture initiative. No funding was approved.

In Fiscal Year 2002, Congress added $25 million to NASAʼs 
budget for Vehicle Assembly Building repairs. NASA has 
reallocated limited funds from the Shuttle budget to press-
ing infrastructure repairs, and intends to take an integrated 
look  at  infrastructure  as  part  of  its  new  Shuttle  Service 
Life  Extension  Program.  Nonetheless,  like  Space  Shuttle 
upgrades,  infrastructure  revitalization  has  been  mired  by 
the uncertainty surrounding the Shuttle Programʼs lifetime. 
Considering that the Shuttle will likely be flying for many 
years to come, NASA, the White House, and Congress alike 
now face the specter of having to deal with years of infra-
structure neglect.

5.6  A CHANGE IN NASA LEADERSHIP

Daniel  Goldin  left  NASA  in  November  2001  after  more 
than nine years as Administrator. The White House chose 
Sean  OʼKeefe,  the  Deputy  Director  of  the  White  House 
Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  as  his  replacement. 
OʼKeefe stated as he took office that he was not a “rocket 
scientist,” but rather that his expertise was in the manage-
ment of large government programs. His appointment was 
an explicit acknowledgement by the new Bush administra-
tion that NASAʼs primary problems were managerial and 
financial. 

By the time OʼKeefe arrived, NASA managers had come to 
recognize that 1990s funding reductions for the Space Shut-
tle Program had resulted in an excessively fragile program, 
and also realized that a Space Shuttle replacement was not 
on the horizon. In 2002, with these issues in mind, OʼKeefe 
made a number of changes to the Space Shuttle Program. 
He transferred management of both the Space Shuttle Pro-
gram  and  the  International  Space  Station  from  Johnson 
Space Center to NASA Headquarters. OʼKeefe also began 
considering  whether  to  expand  the  Space  Flight  Opera-
tions Contract to cover additional Space Shuttle elements, 
or to pursue “competitive sourcing,” a Bush administration 
initiative that encouraged government agencies to compete 
with the private sector for management responsibilities of 
publicly funded activities. To research whether competitive 
sourcing would be a viable approach for the Space Shuttle 
Program,  NASA  chartered  the  Space  Shuttle  Competitive 
Sourcing  Task  Force  through  the  RAND  Corporation,  a 
federally funded think tank. In its report, the Task Force rec-
ognized the many obstacles to transferring the Space Shuttle 
to non-NASA management, primarily NASAʼs reticence to 
relinquish control, but concluded that “NASA must pursue 
competitive sourcing in one form or another.”68

NASA began a “Strategic Management of Human Capital” 
initiative  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  future  NASA  work-
force. The goal is to address the various external and internal 
challenges that NASA faces as it tries to ensure an appropri-
ate mix and depth of skills for future program requirements. 
A  number  of  aspects  to  its  Strategic  Human  Capital  Plan 
require  legislative  approval  and  are  currently  before  the 
Congress.

The  new  NASA  leadership  also  began  to  compare  Space 
Shuttle  program  practices  with  the  practices  of  similar 
high-technology,  high-risk  enterprises.  The  Navy  nuclear 
submarine program was the first enterprise selected for com-
parative analysis. An interim report on this “benchmarking” 
effort was presented to NASA in December 2002.69

In November 2002, NASA made a fundamental change in 
strategy. In what was called the Integrated Space Transpor-
tation Plan (see Figure 5.6-1), NASA shifted money from 
the Space Launch Initiative to the Space Shuttle and Inter-
national Space Station programs. The plan also introduced 
the Orbital Space Plane as a complement to the Shuttle for 
the immediate future. Under this strategy, the Shuttle is to 
fly through at least 2010, when a decision will be made on 
how long to extend Shuttle operations – possibly through 
2020 or even beyond.

As a step in implementing the plan, NASA included $281.4 
million in its Fiscal Year 2004 budget submission to begin 
a Shuttle Service Life Extension Program,70 which NASA 
describes as a “strategic and proactive program designed to 
keep  the  Space  Shuttle  flying  safely  and  efficiently.” The 
program includes “high priority projects for safety, support-
ability, and infrastructure” in order to “combat obsolescence 
of vehicle, ground systems, and facilities.”71

When the Bush Administration came to the White House in 
January 2001, the International Space Station program was 
$4  billion over its projected budget. The Administrationʼs 
Fiscal  Year  2002  budget,  released  in  February  2001,  de-
clared that the International Space Station would be limited 
to a “U.S Core Complete” configuration, a reduced design 
that  could  accommodate  only  three  crew  members.  The 
last step in completing the U.S. portion of this configura-
tion would be the addition of the Italian-supplied but U.S.-
owned “Node 2,” which would allow Europe and Japan to 
connect their laboratory modules to the Station. Launching 
Node 2 and thereby finishing “core complete” configuration 
became an important political and programmatic milestone 
(see Figure 5.7-1).

tional Space Station.

During  congressional  testimony  in  May  of  2001,  Sean 
OʼKeefe, who was then Deputy Director of the White House 
Office of Management and Budget, presented the Adminis-
trationʼs plan to bring International Space Station costs un-
der control. The plan outlined a reduction in assembly and 
logistics flights to reach “core complete” configuration from 
36 to 30. It also recommended redirecting about $1 billion in 
funding by canceling U.S. elements not yet completed, such 
as the habitation module and the X-38 Crew Return Vehicle. 
The X-38 would have allowed emergency evacuation and 
landing capability for a seven-member station crew. Without 
it, the crew was limited to three, the number that could fit 
into a Russian Soyuz crew rescue vehicle.

5. 7  THE RETURN OF SCHEDULE PRESSURE

In his remarks, OʼKeefe stated:

The International Space Station has been the centerpiece of 
NASAʼs human space flight program in the 1990s. In several 
instances, funds for the Shuttle Program have paid for vari-
ous International Space Station items. The Space Station has 
also  affected  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  schedule.  By  the 
time the functional cargo block Zarya, the Space Stationʼs 
first element, was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome 
in  Kazakhstan  in  November  1998,  the  Space  Station  was 
two years behind schedule. The launch of STS-88, the first 
of many Shuttle missions assigned to station assembly, fol-
lowed  a  month  later.  Another  four  assembly  missions  in 
1999  and  2000  readied  the  station  for  its  first  permanent 
crew, Expedition 1, which arrived in late 2000. 

NASAʼs  degree  of  success  in  gaining  control  of  cost 
growth on Space Station will not only dictate the ca-
pabilities that the Station will provide, but will send a 
strong signal about the ability of NASAʼs Human Space 
Flight program to effectively manage large development 
programs.  NASAʼs  credibility  with  the  Administration 
and  the  Congress  for  delivering  on  what  is  promised 
and the longer-term implications that such credibility 
may have on the future of Human Space Flight hang in 
the balance.72

At the request of the White House Office of Management 
and Budget, in July 2001 NASA Administrator Dan Goldin

formed  an  International  Space  Station  Management  and 
Cost Evaluation Task Force. The International Space Station 
Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force was to assist 
NASA in identifying the reforms needed to restore the Sta-
tion Programʼs fiscal and management credibility.

While the primary focus of the Task Force was on the Space 
Station  Program  management,  its  November  2001  report 
issued a general condemnation of how NASA, and particu-
larly Johnson Space Center, had managed the International 
Space Station, and by implication, NASAʼs overall human 
space  flight  effort.  73  The  report  noted  “existing  deficien-
cies  in  management  structure,  institutional  culture,  cost 
estimating, and program control,” and that “the institutional 
needs  of  the  [human  space  flight]  Centers  are  driving  the 
Program, rather than Program requirements being served by 
the Centers.” The Task Force suggested that as a cost control 
measure, the Space Shuttle be limited to four flights per year 
and that NASA revise the station crew rotation period to six 
months. The cost savings that would result from eliminating 
flights could be used to offset cost overruns.

NASA accepted a reduced flight rate. The Space Shuttle Pro-
gram office concluded that, based on a rate of four flights a 
year, Node 2 could be launched by February 19, 2004.

In  testimony  before  the  House  Committee  on  Science  on 
November  7,  2001,  Task  Force  Chairman  Thomas Young 
identified what became known as a “performance gate.”  He 
suggested that over the next two years, NASA should plan 
and implement a credible “core complete” program. In Fall 
2003,  “an  assessment  would  be  made  concerning  the  ISS 
program  performance  and  NASAʼs  credibility.  If  satisfac-
tory, resource needs would be assessed and an [ISS] ʻend 
stateʼ that realized the science potential would become the 
baseline. If unsatisfactory, the core complete program would 
become the ʻend state.ʼ ”74

Testifying the same day, Office of Management and Budget 
Deputy  Director  Sean  OʼKeefe  indicated  the Administra-
tionʼs agreement with the planned performance gate:

The concept presented by the task force of a decision 
gate in two years that could lead to an end state other 
than the U.S. core complete Station is an innovative ap-
proach, and one the Administration will adopt. It calls 
for NASA to make the necessary management reforms to 
successfully build the core complete Station and oper-
ate it within the $8.3 billion available through FY 2006 
plus other human space flight resources … If NASA fails 
to meet the standards, then an end-state beyond core 
complete is not an option. The strategy places the bur-
den of proof on NASA performance to ensure that NASA 
fully implements the needed reforms.75

Mr. OʼKeefe added in closing:

A most important next step – one on which the success of 
all these reforms hinges – is to provide new leadership 
for NASA and its Human Space Flight activities. NASA 
has been well-served by Dan Goldin. New leadership 
is now necessary to continue moving the ball down the 

field with the goal line in sight. The Administration rec-
ognizes the importance of getting the right leaders in 
place as soon as possible, and I am personally engaged 
in making sure that this happens.

A  week  later,  Sean  OʼKeefe  was  nominated  by  President 
Bush as the new NASA Administrator.

To meet the new flight schedule, in 2002 NASA revised its 
Shuttle manifest, calling for a docking adaptor to be installed 
in Columbia after the STS-107 mission so that it could make 
an October 2003 flight to the International Space Station. 
Columbia was not optimal for Station flights – the Orbiter 
could not carry enough payload – but it was assigned to this 
flight  because  Discovery  was  scheduled  for  18  months  of 
major maintenance. To ensure adequate Shuttle availability 
for the February 2004 Node 2 launch date, Columbia would 
fly an International Space Station resupply mission.

The White  House  and  Congress  had  put  the  International 
Space  Station  Program,  the  Space  Shuttle  Program,  and 
indeed  NASA  on  probation.  NASA  had  to  prove  it  could 
meet  schedules  within  cost,  or  risk  halting  Space  Station 
construction  at  core  complete  –  a  configuration  far  short 
of  what  NASA  anticipated.  The  new  NASA  management 
viewed the achievement of an on-schedule Node 2 launch 
as an endorsement of its successful approach to Shuttle and 
Station Programs. Any suggestions that it would be difficult 
to meet that launch date were brushed aside.

This insistence on a fixed launch schedule was worrisome. 
The  International  Space  Station  Management  and  Cost 
Evaluation  Task  Force,  in  particular,  was  concerned  with 
the emphasis on a specific launch date. It noted in its 2002 
review of progress toward meeting its recommendations that 
“significant progress has been made in nearly all aspects of 
the ISS Program,” but that there was “significant risk with 
the Node 2 (February ʼ04) schedule.”76

By  November  2002,  NASA  had  flown  16  Space  Shuttle 
missions dedicated to Station assembly and crew rotation. 
Five  crews  had  lived  onboard  the  Station,  the  last  four 
of  them  delivered  via  Space  Shuttles. As  the  Station  had 
grown, so had the complexity of the missions required to 
complete it. With the International Space Station assembly 
more than half complete, the Station and Shuttle programs 
had become irreversibly linked. Any problems with or per-
turbations to the planned schedule of one program rever-
berated  through  both  programs.  For  the  Shuttle  program, 
this meant that the conduct of all missions, even non-Sta-
tion missions like STS-107, would have an impact on the 
Node 2 launch date.

In 2002, this reality, and the events of the months that would 
follow, began to place additional schedule pressures on the 
Space  Shuttle  Program.  Those  pressures  are  discussed  in 
Section 6.2.
5.8  CONCLUSION

Over the last decade, the Space Shuttle Program has oper-
ated in a challenging and often turbulent environment. As

and  suggested  that  “a  decade  of  downsizing  and  budget 
tightening has left NASA exploring the universe with a less 
experienced staff and older equipment.”78

It is the Boardʼs view that this latter statement is an accurate 
depiction of the Space Shuttle Program at the time of STS-
107. The Program was operating too close to too many mar-
gins. The Board also finds that recent modest increases in the 
Shuttle  Programʼs  budget  are  necessary  and  overdue  steps 
toward providing the resources to sustain the program for its 
now-extended lifetime. Similarly, NASA has recently recog-
nized that providing an adequately sized and appropriately 
trained workforce is critical to the agencyʼs future success. 

An  examination  of  the  Programʼs  management  changes 
also leads to the question: Did turmoil in the management 
structure contribute to the accident? The Board found no 
evidence that the transition from many Space Shuttle con-
tractors to a partial consolidation of contracts under a single 
firm has by itself introduced additional technical risk into 
the Space Shuttle Program. The transfer of responsibilities 
that has accompanied the Space Flight Operations Contract 
has,  however,  complicated  an  already  complex  Program 
structure  and  created  barriers  to  effective  communica-
tion.  Designating  the  Johnson  Space  Center  as  the  “lead 
center” for the Space Shuttle Program did resurrect some 
of the Center rivalries and communication difficulties that 
existed before the Challenger accident. The specific ways 
in which this complexity and lack of an integrated approach 
to Shuttle management impinged on NASAʼs performance 
during  and  before  the  flight  of  STS-107  are  discussed  in 
Chapters 6 and 7.

As the 21st century began, NASAʼs deeply ingrained human 
space flight culture – one that has evolved over 30 years as 
the basis for a more conservative, less technically and orga-
nizationally capable organization than the Apollo-era NASA 
– remained strong enough to resist external pressures for ad-
aptation and change. At the time of the launch of STS-107, 
NASA retained too many negative (and also many positive) 
aspects of its traditional culture: “flawed decision making, 
self deception, introversion and a diminished curiosity about 
the world outside the perfect place.”79 These characteristics 
were reflected in NASAʼs less than stellar performance be-
fore and during the STS-107 mission, which is described in 
the following chapters.

discussed  in  this  chapter,  there  were  at  least  three  major 
contributing factors to that environment:

•  Throughout  the  decade,  the  Shuttle  Program  has  had 
to function within an increasingly constrained budget. 
Both the Shuttle budget and workforce have been re-
duced by over 40 percent during the past decade. The 
White House, Congress, and NASA leadership exerted 
constant pressure to reduce or at least freeze operating 
costs. As a result, there was little margin in the budget 
to  deal  with  unexpected  technical  problems  or  make 
Shuttle improvements. 

•  The  Shuttle  was  mischaracterized  by  the  1995  Kraft 
Report  as  “a  mature  and  reliable  system  …  about  as 
safe  as  todayʼs  technology  will  provide.”  Based  on 
this mischaracterization, NASA believed that it could 
turn  increased  responsibilities  for  Shuttle  operations 
over to a single prime contractor and reduce its direct 
involvement  in  ensuring  safe  Shuttle  operations,  in-
stead monitoring contractor performance from a more 
detached position. NASA also believed that it could use 
the “mature” Shuttle to carry out operational missions 
without  continually  focusing  engineering  attention  on 
understanding the mission-by-mission anomalies inher-
ent in a developmental vehicle.

•  In the 1990s, the planned date for replacing the Shuttle 
shifted  from  2006  to  2012  and  then  to  2015  or  later. 
Given  the  uncertainty  regarding  the  Shuttleʼs  service 
life, there has been policy and budgetary ambivalence 
on investing in the vehicle. Only in the past year has 
NASA begun to provide the resources needed to sus-
tain extended Shuttle operations. Previously, safety and 
support upgrades were delayed or deferred, and Shuttle 
infrastructure was allowed to deteriorate. 

The  Board  observes  that  this  is  hardly  an  environment  in 
which those responsible for safe operation of the Shuttle can 
function without being influenced by external pressures. It 
is to the credit of Space Shuttle managers and the Shuttle 
workforce that the vehicle was able to achieve its program 
objectives for as long as it did. 

An  examination  of  the  Shuttle  Programʼs  history  from 
Challenger to Columbia raises the question: Did the Space 
Shuttle  Program  budgets  constrained  by  the White  House 
and Congress threaten safe Shuttle operations? There is no 
straightforward answer. In 1994, an analysis of the Shuttle 
budget concluded that reductions made in the early 1990s 
represented  a  “healthy  tightening  up”  of  the  program.77 
Certainly  those  in  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
and in NASAʼs congressional authorization and appropria-
tions  subcommittees  thought  they  were  providing  enough 
resources to operate the Shuttle safely, while also taking into 
account the expected Shuttle lifetime and the many other de-
mands on the Federal budget. NASA Headquarters agreed, 
at least until Administrator Goldin declared a “space launch 
crisis” in June 1999 and asked that additional resources for 
safety  upgrades  be  added  to  the  NASA  budget.  By  2001, 
however,  one  experienced  observer  of  the  space  program 
described  the  Shuttle  workforce  as  “The  Few,  the Tired,”

source of some stress.

CHAPTER 6

Decision Making
at NASA

The dwindling post-Cold War Shuttle budget that launched 
NASA leadership on a crusade for efficiency in the decade 
before Columbiaʼs final flight powerfully shaped the envi-
ronment in which Shuttle managers worked. The increased 
organizational  complexity,  transitioning  authority  struc-
tures,  and  ambiguous  working  relationships  that  defined 
the restructured Space Shuttle Program in the 1990s created 
turbulence that repeatedly influenced decisions made before 
and during STS-107.

This  chapter  connects  Chapter  5ʼs  analysis  of  NASAʼs 
broader policy environment to a focused scrutiny of Space 
Shuttle Program decisions that led to the STS-107 accident. 
Section 6.1 illustrates how foam debris losses that violated 
design requirements came to be defined by NASA manage-
ment as an acceptable aspect of Shuttle missions, one that 
posed  merely  a  maintenance  “turnaround”  problem  rather 
than a safety-of-flight concern. Section 6.2 shows how, at a 
pivotal juncture just months before the Columbia accident, 
the management goal of completing Node 2 of the Interna-
tional Space Station on time encouraged Shuttle managers 
to continue flying, even after a significant bipod-foam debris 
strike  on  STS-112.  Section  6.3  notes  the  decisions  made 
during STS-107 in response to the bipod foam strike, and 
reveals how engineersʼ concerns about risk and safety were 
competing with – and were defeated by – managementʼs be-
lief that foam could not hurt the Orbiter, as well as the need 
to keep on schedule. In relating a rescue and repair scenario 
that might have enabled the crewʼs safe return, Section 6.4 
grapples with yet another latent assumption held by Shuttle 
managers during and after STS-107: that even if the foam 
strike had been discovered, nothing could have been done.
6.1  A HISTORY OF FOAM ANOMALIES

The shedding of External Tank foam – the physical cause of 
the Columbia accident – had a long history. Damage caused 
by debris has occurred on every Space Shuttle flight, and 
most missions have had insulating foam shed during ascent. 
This raises an obvious question: Why did NASA continue 

flying the Shuttle with a known problem that violated de-
sign requirements? It would seem that the longer the Shuttle 
Program allowed debris to continue striking the Orbiters, 
the more opportunity existed to detect the serious threat it 
posed. But this is not what happened. Although engineers 
have made numerous changes in foam design and applica-
tion in the 25 years that the External Tank has been in pro-
duction, the problem of foam-shedding has not been solved, 
nor has the Orbiterʼs ability to tolerate impacts from foam 
or other debris been significantly improved.

The Need for Foam Insulation

The  External  Tank  contains  liquid  oxygen  and  hydrogen 
propellants stored at minus 297 and minus 423 degrees Fahr-
enheit. Were the super-cold External Tank not sufficiently in-
sulated from the warm air, its liquid propellants would boil, 
and atmospheric nitrogen and water vapor would condense 
and form thick layers of ice on its surface. Upon launch, the 
ice could break off and damage the Orbiter. (See Chapter 3.)

To  prevent  this  from  happening,  large  areas  of  the  Exter-
nal  Tank  are  machine-sprayed  with  one  or  two  inches  of 
foam, while specific fixtures, such as the bipod ramps, are 
hand-sculpted with thicker coats. Most of these insulating 
materials  fall  into  a  general  category  of  “foam,”  and  are 
outwardly similar to hardware store-sprayable foam insula-
tion. The problem is that foam does not always stay where 
the External Tank manufacturer Lockheed Martin installs it. 
During flight, popcorn- to briefcase-size chunks detach from 
the External Tank. 

Original Design Requirements

Early in the Space Shuttle Program, foam loss was consid-
ered a dangerous problem. Design engineers were extremely 
concerned  about  potential  damage  to  the  Orbiter  and  its 
fragile  Thermal  Protection  System,  parts  of  which  are  so 
vulnerable to impacts that lightly pressing a thumbnail into 
them leaves a mark. Because of these concerns, the baseline

design  requirements  in  the  Shuttleʼs  “Flight  and  Ground 
System  Specification-Book  1,  Requirements,”  precluded 
foam-shedding by the External Tank. Specifically: 

3.2.1.2.14 Debris Prevention: The Space Shuttle Sys-
tem, including the ground systems, shall be designed to 
preclude the shedding of ice and/or other debris from 
the  Shuttle  elements  during  prelaunch  and  flight  op-
erations that would jeopardize the flight crew, vehicle, 
mission success, or would adversely impact turnaround 
operations.1

3.2.1.1.17  External  Tank  Debris  Limits:  No  debris 
shall  emanate  from  the  critical  zone  of  the  External 
Tank on the launch pad or during ascent except for such 
material which may result from normal thermal protec-
tion system recession due to ascent heating.2

The assumption that only tiny pieces of debris would strike 
the Orbiter was also built into original design requirements, 
which  specified  that  the  Thermal  Protection  System  (the 
tiles and Reinforced Carbon-Carbon, or RCC, panels) would 
be built to withstand impacts with a kinetic energy less than 
0.006 foot-pounds. Such a small tolerance leaves the Orbiter 
vulnerable to strikes from birds, ice, launch pad debris, and 
pieces of foam.

Despite the design requirement that the External Tank shed 
no debris, and that the Orbiter not be subjected to any sig-
nificant debris hits, Columbia sustained damage from debris 
strikes on its inaugural 1981 flight. More than 300 tiles had 
to be replaced.3 Engineers stated that had they known in ad-
vance that the External Tank “was going to produce the de-
bris shower that occurred” during launch, “they would have 
had a difficult time clearing Columbia for flight.”4 

Discussion of Foam Strikes
Prior to the Rogers Commission

Foam  strikes  were  a  topic  of  management  concern  at  the 
time  of  the  Challenger  accident.  In  fact,  during  the  Rog-
ers  Commission  accident  investigation,  Shuttle  Program 
Manager Arnold Aldrich cited a contractorʼs concerns about 
foam shedding to illustrate how well the Shuttle Program 
manages risk:

On a series of four or five external tanks, the thermal 
insulation  around  the  inner  tank  …  had  large  divots 
of  insulation  coming  off  and  impacting  the  Orbiter. 
We found significant amount of damage to one Orbiter 
after a flight and … on the subsequent flight we had a 
camera in the equivalent of the wheel well, which took a 
picture of the tank after separation, and we determined 
that this was in fact the cause of the damage. At that 
time, we wanted to be able to proceed with the launch 
program if it was acceptable … so we undertook discus-
sions of what would be acceptable in terms of potential 
field  repairs,  and  during  those  discussions,  Rockwell 
was very conservative because, rightly, damage to the 
Orbiter TPS [Thermal Protection System] is damage to 
the Orbiter system, and it has a very stringent environ-
ment to experience during the re-entry phase.

Aldrich  described  the  pieces  of  foam  as  “…  half  a  foot 
square  or  a  foot  by  half  a  foot,  and  some  of  them  much 
smaller and localized to a specific area, but fairly high up on 
the tank. So they had a good shot at the Orbiter underbelly, 
and this is where we had the damage.”5 

Continuing Foam Loss

Despite the high level of concern after STS-1 and through 
the Challenger accident, foam continued to separate from 
the External Tank. Photographic evidence of foam shedding 
exists for 65 of the 79 missions for which imagery is avail-
able. Of the 34 missions for which there are no imagery, 8 
missions where foam loss is not seen in the imagery, and 6 
missions where imagery is inconclusive, foam loss can be 
inferred from the number of divots on the Orbiterʼs lower 
surfaces. Over the life of the Space Shuttle Program, Orbit-
ers have returned with an average of 143 divots in the upper 
and lower surfaces of the Thermal Protection System tiles, 
with 31 divots averaging over an inch in one dimension.6 
(The Orbitersʼ lower surfaces have an average of 101 hits, 
23 of which are larger than an inch in diameter.) Though 
the Orbiter is also struck by ice and pieces of launch-pad 
hardware  during  launch,  by  micrometeoroids  and  orbital 
debris in space, and by runway debris during landing, the 
Board  concludes  that  foam  is  likely  responsible  for  most 
debris hits.

With each successful landing, it appears that NASA engi-
neers  and  managers  increasingly  regarded  the  foam-shed-
ding as inevitable, and as either unlikely to jeopardize safety 
or simply an acceptable risk. The distinction between foam 
loss and debris events also appears to have become blurred. 
NASA and contractor personnel came to view foam strikes 
not as a safety of flight issue, but rather a simple mainte-
nance,  or  “turnaround”  issue.  In  Flight  Readiness  Review 
documentation,  Mission  Management  Team  minutes,  In-
Flight  Anomaly  disposition  reports,  and  elsewhere,  what 
was  originally  considered  a  serious  threat  to  the  Orbiter 

DEFINITIONS
In Family: A reportable problem that was previously experi-
enced, analyzed, and understood. Out of limits performance 
or discrepancies that have been previously experienced may 
be considered as in-family when specifically approved by the 
Space Shuttle Program or design project.8

Out  of  Family:  Operation  or  performance  outside  the  ex-
pected performance range for a given parameter or which has 
not previously been experienced.9

Accepted  Risk:  The  threat  associated  with  a  specific  cir-
cumstance is known and understood, cannot be completely 
eliminated, and the circumstance(s) producing that threat is 
considered unlikely to reoccur. Hence, the circumstance is 
fully known and is considered a tolerable threat to the con-
duct of a Shuttle mission.

No  Safety-of-Flight-Issue:  The  threat  associated  with  a 
specific circumstance is known and understood and does not 
pose a threat to the crew and/or vehicle.

came to be treated as “in-family,” 7 a reportable problem that 
was within the known experience base, was believed to be 
understood, and was not regarded as a safety-of-flight issue.

Bipod Ramp Foam Loss Events

Chunks  of  foam  from  the  External Tankʼs  forward  bipod 
attachment,  which  connects  the  Orbiter  to  the  External 
Tank,  are  some  of  the  largest  pieces  of  debris  that  have 
struck  the  Orbiter. To  place  the  foam  loss  from  STS-107 
in  a  broader  context,  the  Board  examined  every  known 
instance of foam-shedding from this area. Foam loss from 
the left bipod ramp (called the –Y ramp in NASA parlance) 
has been confirmed by imagery on 7 of the 113 missions 
flown. However, only on 72 of these missions was available 
imagery of sufficient quality to determine left bipod ramp 
foam loss. Therefore, foam loss from the left bipod area oc-
curred on approximately 10 percent of flights (seven events 
out of 72 imaged flights). On the 66 flights that imagery 
was available for the right bipod area, foam loss was never 
observed. NASA could not explain why only the left bipod 
experienced foam loss. (See Figure 6.1-1.)

The first known bipod ramp foam loss occurred during STS-7,
Challengerʼs  second  mission  (see  Figure  6.1-2).  Images 
taken after External Tank separation revealed that a 19- by 
12-inch piece of the left bipod ramp was missing, and that the 
External Tank had some 25 shallow divots in the foam just 
forward of the bipod struts and another 40 divots in the foam 
covering  the  lower  External  Tank.  After  the  mission  was 
completed, the Program Requirements Control Board cited 
the foam loss as an In-Flight Anomaly. Citing an event as an 
In-Flight Anomaly means that before the next launch, a spe-
cific NASA organization must resolve the problem or prove 
that it does not threaten the safety of the vehicle or crew.11 

At the Flight Readiness Review for the next mission, Orbiter 
Project management reported that, based on the completion 
of  repairs  to  the  Orbiter  Thermal  Protection  System,  the 
bipod ramp foam loss In-Flight Anomaly was resolved, or 
“closed.” However, although the closure documents detailed 
the  repairs  made  to  the  Orbiter,  neither  the  Certificate  of 
Flight  Readiness  documentation  nor  the  Flight  Readiness 
Review  documentation  referenced  correcting  the  cause  of 
the damage – the shedding of foam.

curred on STS-7 which was launched on June 18, 1983.

UMBILICAL CAMERAS AND THE 
STATISTICS OF BIPOD RAMP LOSS
Over the course of the 113 Space Shuttle missions, the left 
bipod ramp has shed significant pieces of foam at least seven 
times. (Foam-shedding from the right bipod ramp has never 
been confirmed. The right bipod ramp may be less subject to 
foam shedding because it is partially shielded from aerody-
namic forces by the External Tankʼs liquid oxygen line.) The 
fact  that  five  of  these  left  bipod  shedding  events  occurred 
on missions flown by Columbia sparked considerable Board 
debate. Although initially this appeared to be a improbable 
coincidence that would have caused the Board to fault NASA 
for improper trend analysis and lack of engineering curiosity, 
on closer inspection, the Board concluded that this “coinci-
dence” is probably the result of a bias in the sample of known 
bipod foam-shedding. Before the Challenger accident, only 
Challenger  and  Columbia  carried  umbilical  well  cameras 
that imaged the External Tank after separation, so there are 
more images of Columbia than of the other Orbiters.10 

The bipod was imaged 26 of 28 of Columbiaʼs missions; in 
contrast, Challenger had 7 of 10, Discovery had only 14 of 
30, Atlantis only 14 of 26, and Endeavour 12 of 19. 

The second bipod ramp foam loss occurred during STS-32R, 
Columbiaʼs ninth flight, on January 9, 1990. A post-mission 
review of STS-32R photography revealed five divots in the 
intertank foam ranging from 6 to 28 inches in diameter, the 
largest of which extended into the left bipod ramp foam. A 
post-mission inspection of the lower surface of the Orbiter 
revealed 111 hits, 13 of which were one inch or greater in 
one dimension. An In-Flight Anomaly assigned to the Ex-
ternal Tank Project was closed out at the Flight Readiness 
Review for the next mission, STS-36, on the basis that there 
may have been local voids in the foam bipod ramp where 
it attached to the metal skin of the External Tank. To ad-
dress  the  foam  loss,  NASA  engineers  poked  small  “vent 
holes” through the intertank foam to allow trapped gases to 
escape voids in the foam where they otherwise might build 
up pressure and cause the foam to pop off. However, NASA 
is still studying this hypothesized mechanism of foam loss. 
Experiments conducted under the Boardʼs purview indicate 
that other mechanisms may be at work. (See “Foam Fracture 
Under Hydrostatic Pressure” in Chapter 3.) As discussed in 
Chapter  3,  the  Board  notes  that  the  persistent  uncertainty 
about the causes of foam loss and potential Orbiter damage 
results from a lack of thorough hazard analysis and engi-
neering attention. 

The third bipod foam loss occurred on June 25, 1992, during 
the launch of Columbia on STS-50, when an approximately 
26-  by  10-inch  piece  separated  from  the  left  bipod  ramp 
area. Post-mission inspection revealed a 9-inch by 4.5-inch 
by 0.5-inch divot in the tile, the largest area of tile damage in 
Shuttle history. The External Tank Project at Marshall Space 
Flight Center and the Integration Office at Johnson Space 
Center cited separate In-Flight Anomalies. The Integration 
Office  closed  out  its  In-Flight  Anomaly  two  days  before 
the next flight, STS-46, by deeming damage to the Thermal 
Protection  System  an  “accepted  flight  risk.”12  In  Integra-
tion Hazard Report 37, the Integration Office noted that the 

impact damage was shallow, the tile loss was not a result 
of  excessive  aerodynamic  loads,  and  the  External  Tank 
Thermal Protection System failure was the result of “inad-
equate venting.”13 The External Tank Project closed out its 
In-Flight Anomaly with the rationale that foam loss during 
ascent was “not considered a flight or safety issue.”14 Note 
the difference in how the each program addressed the foam-
shedding problem: While the Integration Office deemed it 
an “accepted risk,” the External Tank Project considered it 
“not a safety-of-flight issue.” Hazard Report 37 would figure 
in the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review, where the crucial 
decision  was  made  to  continue  flying  with  the  foam-loss 
problem. This inconsistency would reappear 10 years later, 
after bipod foam-shedding during STS-112. 

The fourth and fifth bipod ramp foam loss events went un-
detected until the Board directed NASA to review all avail-
able imagery for other instances of bipod foam-shedding. 
This review of imagery from tracking cameras, the umbili-
cal well camera, and video and still images from flight crew 
hand held cameras revealed bipod foam loss on STS-52 and 
STS-62, both of which were flown by Columbia. STS-52, 
launched on October 22, 1992, lost an 8- by 4-inch corner 
of the left bipod ramp as well as portions of foam cover-
ing  the  left  jackpad,  a  piece  of  External  Tank  hardware 
that facilitates the Orbiter attachment process. The STS-52 
post-mission  inspection  noted  a  higher-than-average  290 
hits on upper and lower Thermal Protection System tiles, 
16 of which were greater than one inch in one dimension. 
External  Tank  separation  videos  of  STS-62,  launched  on 
March 4, 1994, revealed that a 1- by 3-inch piece of foam 
in the rear face of the left bipod ramp was missing, as were 
small pieces of foam around the bipod ramp. Because these 
incidents  of  missing  bipod  foam  were  not  detected  until 
after  the  STS-107  accident,  no  In-Flight  Anomalies  had 
been written. The Board concludes that NASAʼs failure to 
identify these bipod foam losses at the time they occurred 
means the agency must examine the adequacy of its film 
review, post-flight inspection, and Program Requirements 
Control Board processes. 

The  sixth  and  final  bipod  ramp  event  before  STS-107  oc-
curred during STS-112 on October 7, 2002 (see Figure 6.1-
3). At 33 seconds after launch, when Atlantis was at 12,500 
feet and traveling at Mach 0.75, ground cameras observed 
an object traveling from the External Tank that subsequently 
impacted  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster/External  Tank  Attach-
ment ring (see Figure 6.1-4). After impact, the debris broke 
into multiple pieces that fell along the Solid Rocket Booster 
exhaust plume.15 Post-mission inspection of the Solid Rocket 
Booster confirmed damage to foam on the forward face of 
the External Tank Attachment ring. The impact was approxi-
mately 4 inches wide and 3 inches deep. Post-External Tank 
separation photography by the crew showed that a 4- by 5- 
by 12-inch (240 cubic-inch) corner section of the left bipod 
ramp  was  missing,  which  exposed  the  super  lightweight 
ablator coating on the bipod housing. This missing chunk of 
foam was believed to be the debris that impacted the External 
Tank Attachment ring during ascent. The post-launch review 
of photos and video identified these debris events, but the 
Mission  Evaluation  Room  logs  and  Mission  Management 
Team minutes do not reflect any discussions of them.

Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore and attended by 
many of the managers who would be actively involved with 
STS-107, including Linda Ham, the Program Requirements 
Control  Board  ultimately  decided  against  such  classifica-
tion. Instead, after discussions with the Integration Office 
and the External Tank Project, the Program Requirements 
Control  Board  Chairman  assigned  an  “action”  to  the  Ex-
ternal Tank Project to determine the root cause of the foam 
loss and to propose corrective action. This was inconsistent 
with  previous  practice,  in  which  all  other  known  bipod 
foam-shedding was designated as In-Flight Anomalies. The 
Program Requirements Control Board initially set Decem-
ber 5, 2002, as the date to report back on this action, even 
though STS-113 was scheduled to launch on November 10. 
The due date subsequently slipped until after the planned 
launch and return of STS-107. The Space Shuttle Program 
decided to fly not one but two missions before resolving the 
STS-112 foam loss.

The Board wondered why NASA would treat the STS-112 
foam loss differently than all others. What drove managers 
to reject the recommendation that the foam loss be deemed 
an In-Flight Anomaly? Why did they take the unprecedented 
step of scheduling not one but eventually two missions to fly 
before the External Tank Project was to report back on foam 
losses? It seems that Shuttle managers had become condi-
tioned over time to not regard foam loss or debris as a safety-
of-flight concern. As will be discussed in Section 6.2, the 
need to adhere to the Node 2 launch schedule also appears 
to have influenced their decision. Had the STS-113 mission 
been delayed beyond early December 2002, the Expedition 
5 crew on board the Space Station would have exceeded its 
180-day on-orbit limit, and the Node 2 launch date, a major 
management goal, would not be met.

Even  though  the  results  of  the  External  Tank  Project  en-
gineering  analysis  were  not  due  until  after  STS-113,  the 
foam-shedding  was  reported,  or  “briefed,”  at  STS-113ʼs 
Flight Readiness Review on October 31, 2002, a meeting 
that Dittemore and Ham attended. Two slides from this brief 
(Figure 6.1-5) explain the disposition of bipod ramp foam 
loss on STS-112. 

Figure  6.1-4.  On  STS-112,  the  foam  impacted  the  External  Tank 
Attach ring on the Solid Rocket Booster, causing this tear in the 
insulation on the ring.

STS-113 Flight Readiness Review: A Pivotal Decision

Because the bipod ramp shedding on STS-112 was signifi-
cant, both in size and in the damage it caused, and because 
it  occurred  only  two  flights  before  STS-107,  the  Board 
investigated NASAʼs rationale to continue flying. This deci-
sion made by the Program Requirements Control Board at 
the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review is among those most 
directly linked to the STS-107 accident. Had the foam loss 
during  STS-112  been  classified  as  a  more  serious  threat, 
managers might have responded differently when they heard 
about the foam strike on STS-107. Alternately, in the face 
of the increased risk, STS-107 might not have flown at all. 
However, at STS-113ʼs Flight Readiness Review, managers 
formally accepted a flight rationale that stated it was safe 
to fly with foam losses. This decision enabled, and perhaps 
even encouraged, Mission Management Team members to 
use  similar  reasoning  when  evaluating  whether  the  foam 
strike on STS-107 posed a safety-of-flight issue. 

At the Program Requirements Control Board meeting fol-
lowing the return of STS-112, the Intercenter Photo Work-
ing  Group  recommended  that  the  loss  of  bipod  foam  be 
classified as an In-Flight Anomaly. In a meeting chaired by

bipod housing SLA closeout

~~

• Background

•

•

ET TPS Foam loss over the life of the Shuttle
Program has never been a "Safety of Flight"
issue
More than 100 External Tanks have flown
with only 3 documented instances of
significant foam loss on a bipod ramp

Missing Foam on
–Y Bipod Ramp

• Rationale for Flight

• Current bipod ramp closeout has not been changed since STS-54 (ET-51)

• The Orbiter has not yet experienced "Safety

of Flight" damage from loss of foam in
112 flights (including 3 known flights
with bipod ramp foam loss)

• There have been no design / process /

equipment changes over the last 60
ETs (flights)

Prior to Foam Closeout

After Final Foam Trim

• All ramp closeout work (including ET-115 and ET-116) was

performed by experienced practitioners (all over 20 years
experience each)

• Ramp foam application involves craftmanship in the use of

validated application processess

• No change in Inspection / Process control / Post application handling, etc

• Probability of loss of ramp TPS is no higher/no lower than previous flights
• The ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added risk)

incorrect since the design of the bipod ramp had changed several times since the flights listed on the slide.

This rationale is seriously flawed. The first and third state-
ments listed under “Rationale for Flight” are incorrect. Con-
trary to the chart, which was presented by Jerry Smelser, the 
Program Manager for the External Tank Project, the bipod 
ramp  design  had  changed,  as  of  External  Tank-76.  This 
casts doubt on the implied argument that because the design 
had  not  changed,  future  bipod  foam  events  were  unlikely 
to  occur. Although  the  other  points  may  be  factually  cor-
rect, they provide an exceptionally weak rationale for safe 
flight.  The  fact  that  ramp  closeout  work  was  “performed 
by experienced practitioners” or that “application involves 
craftsmanship in the use of validated application processes” 
in no way decreases the chances of recurrent foam loss. The 
statement that the “probability of loss of ramp Thermal Pro-
tection System is no higher/no lower than previous flights” 
could be just as accurately stated “the probability of bipod 
foam loss on the next flight is just as high as it was on previ-
ous flights.” With no engineering analysis, Shuttle managers 
used  past  success  as  a  justification  for  future  flights,  and 
made no change to the External Tank configurations planned 
for STS-113, and, subsequently, for STS-107.

Along  with  this  chart,  the  NASA  Headquarters  Safety 
Office presented a report that estimated a 99 percent prob-
ability  of  foam  not  being  shed  from  the  same  area,  even 
though no corrective action had been taken following the 
STS-112 foam-shedding.16 The ostensible justification for 
the 99 percent figure was a calculation of the actual rate of 
bipod loss over 61 flights. This calculation was a sleight-
of-hand effort to make the probability of bipod foam loss 
appear low rather than a serious grappling with the prob-
ability of bipod ramp foam separating. For one thing, the 
calculation equates the probability of left and right bipod 
loss, when right bipod loss has never been observed, and the 
amount of imagery available for left and right bipod events 
differs. The calculation also miscounts the actual number 
of bipod ramp losses in two ways. First, by restricting the 
sample size to flights between STS-112 and the last known 
bipod ramp loss, it excludes known bipod ramp losses from 
STS-7, STS-32R, and STS-50. Second, by failing to project 
the statistical rate of bipod loss across the many missions 
for  which  no  bipod  imagery  is  available,  the  calculation 
assumes a “what you donʼt see wonʼt hurt you” mentality 
when in fact the reverse is true. When the statistical rate 
of bipod foam loss is projected across missions for which 
imagery is not available, and the sample size is extended 
to include every mission from STS-1 on, the probability of 
bipod loss increases dramatically. The Boardʼs review after 
STS-107, which included the discovery of two additional 
bipod  ramp  losses  that  NASA  had  not  previously  noted, 
concluded that bipod foam loss occurred on approximately 
10 percent of all missions. 

During the brief at STS-113ʼs Flight Readiness Review, the 
Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance 
scrutinized  the  Integration  Hazard  Report  37  conclusion 
that debris-shedding was an accepted risk, as well as the 
External  Tank  Projectʼs  rationale  for  flight. After  confer-
ring,  STS-113  Flight  Readiness  Review  participants  ulti-
mately agreed that foam shedding should be characterized 
as an “accepted risk” rather than a “not a safety-of-flight” 
issue.  Space  Shuttle  Program  management  accepted  this 

rationale,  and  STS-113ʼs  Certificate  of  Flight  Readiness 
was signed. 

The decision made at the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review 
seemingly acknowledged that the foam posed a threat to the 
Orbiter, although the continuing disagreement over whether 
foam was “not a safety of flight issue” versus an “accepted 
risk” demonstrates how the two terms became blurred over 
time, clouding the precise conditions under which an increase 
in risk would be permitted by Shuttle Program management. 
In  retrospect,  the  bipod  foam  that  caused  a  4-  by  3-inch 
gouge in the foam on one of Atlantisʼ Solid Rocket Boosters 
– just months before STS-107 – was a “strong signal” of po-
tential future damage that Shuttle engineers ignored. Despite 
the significant bipod foam loss on STS-112, Shuttle Program 
engineers made no External Tank configuration changes, no 
moves to reduce the risk of bipod ramp shedding or poten-
tial damage to the Orbiter on either of the next two flights, 
STS-113 and STS-107, and did not update Integrated Hazard 
Report 37. The Board notes that although there is a process 
for conducting hazard analyses when the system is designed 
and  a  process  for  re-evaluating  them  when  a  design  is 
changed or the component is replaced, no process addresses 
the need to update a hazard analysis when anomalies occur. A 
stronger Integration Office would likely have insisted that In-
tegrated Hazard Analysis 37 be updated. In the course of that 
update, engineers would be forced to consider the cause of 
foam-shedding and the effects of shedding on other Shuttle 
elements, including the Orbiter Thermal Protection System.

STS-113 launched at night, and although it is occasionally 
possible  to  image  the  Orbiter  from  light  given  off  by  the 
Solid Rocket Motor plume, in this instance no imagery was 
obtained and it is possible that foam could have been shed.

The acceptance of the rationale to fly cleared the way for 
Columbiaʼs launch and provided a method for Mission man-
agers to classify the STS-107 foam strike as a maintenance 
and turnaround concern rather than a safety-of-flight issue. 
It is significant that in retrospect, several NASA managers 
identified their acceptance of this flight rationale as a seri-
ous error.

The foam-loss issue was considered so insignificant by some 
Shuttle Program engineers and managers that the STS-107 
Flight Readiness Review documents include no discussion 
of the still-unresolved STS-112 foam loss. According to Pro-
gram rules, this discussion was not a requirement because 
the STS-112 incident was only identified as an “action,” not 
an In-Flight Anomaly. However, because the action was still 
open, and the date of its resolution had slipped, the Board be-
lieves that Shuttle Program managers should have addressed 
it. Had the foam issue been discussed in STS-107 pre-launch 
meetings, Mission managers may have been more sensitive 
to the foam-shedding, and may have taken more aggressive 
steps to determine the extent of the damage.

The seventh and final known bipod ramp foam loss occurred 
on  January  16,  2003,  during  the  launch  of  Columbia  on 
STS-107. After the Columbia bipod loss, the Program Re-
quirements Control Board deemed the foam loss an In-Flight 
Anomaly to be dealt with by the External Tank Project.

Other Foam/Debris Events

To better understand how NASAʼs treatment of debris strikes 
evolved  over  time,  the  Board  investigated  missions  where 
debris was shed from locations other than the External Tank 
bipod  ramp. The  number  of  debris  strikes  to  the  Orbitersʼ 
lower surface Thermal Protection System that resulted in tile 
damage greater than one inch in diameter is shown in Figure 
6.1-6.17 The number of debris strikes may be small, but a 
single strike could damage several tiles (see Figure 6.1-7).

One  debris  strike  in  particular  foreshadows  the  STS-107 
event.  When  Atlantis  was  launched  on  STS-27R  on  De-
cember  2,  1988,  the  largest  debris  event  up  to  that  time 
significantly damaged the Orbiter. Post-launch analysis of 
tracking camera imagery by the Intercenter Photo Working 
Group identified a large piece of debris that struck the Ther-
mal Protection System tile at approximately 85 seconds into 
the flight. On Flight Day Two, Mission Control asked the 
flight crew to inspect Atlantis with a camera mounted on the 
remote manipulator arm, a robotic device that was not in-
stalled on Columbia for STS-107. Mission Commander R.L. 
“Hoot” Gibson later stated that Atlantis “looked like it had 
been blasted by a shotgun.”18 Concerned that the Orbiterʼs 
Thermal Protection System had been breached, Gibson or-
dered that the video be transferred to Mission Control so that 
NASA engineers could evaluate the damage. 

When Atlantis landed, engineers were surprised by the ex-
tent of the damage. Post-mission inspections deemed it “the 
most severe of any mission yet flown.”19 The Orbiter had 
707 dings, 298 of which were greater than an inch in one di-
mension. Damage was concentrated outboard of a line right 
of the bipod attachment to the liquid oxygen umbilical line. 
Even more worrisome, the debris had knocked off a tile, ex-
posing the Orbiterʼs skin to the heat of re-entry. Post-flight 
analysis concluded that structural damage was confined to 
the exposed cavity left by the missing tile, which happened 
to be at the location of a thick aluminum plate covering an 
L-band navigation antenna. Were it not for the thick alumi-

num plate, Gibson stated during a presentation to the Board 
that a burn-through may have occurred.20

The Board notes the distinctly different ways in which the 
STS-27R  and  STS-107  debris  strike  events  were  treated. 
After the discovery of the debris strike on Flight Day Two 
of STS-27R, the crew was immediately directed to inspect 
the vehicle. More severe thermal damage – perhaps even a 
burn-through – may have occurred were it not for the alu-
minum plate at the site of the tile loss. Fourteen years later, 
when a debris strike was discovered on Flight Day Two of 
STS-107, Shuttle Program management declined to have the 
crew inspect the Orbiter for damage, declined to request on-
orbit imaging, and ultimately discounted the possibility of a 
burn-through. In retrospect, the debris strike on STS-27R is 
a “strong signal” of the threat debris posed that should have 
been considered by Shuttle management when STS-107 suf-
fered a similar debris strike. The Board views the failure to 
do so as an illustration of the lack of institutional memory in 
the Space Shuttle Program that supports the Boardʼs claim, 
discussed in Chapter 7, that NASA is not functioning as a 
learning organization.

After  the  STS-27R  damage  was  evaluated  during  a  post-
flight inspection, the Program Requirements Control Board 
assigned In-Flight Anomalies to the Orbiter and Solid Rock-
et  Booster  Projects.  Marshall  Sprayable Ablator  (MSA-1) 
material  found  embedded  in  an  insulation  blanket  on  the 
right Orbital Maneuvering System pod confirmed that the 
ablator on the right Solid Rocket Booster nose cap was the 
most likely source of debris.21 Because an improved ablator 
material (MSA-2) would now be used on the Solid Rocket 
Booster nose cap, the issue was considered “closed” by the 
time  of  the  next  missionʼs  Flight  Readiness  Review.  The 
Orbiter Thermal Protection System review team concurred 
with the use of the improved ablator without reservation.

An STS-27R investigation team notation mirrors a Colum-
bia  Accident  Investigation  Board  finding.  The  STS-27R 
investigation noted: “it is observed that program emphasis

and attention to tile damage assessments varies with severity 
and that detailed records could be augmented to ease trend 
maintenance”  (emphasis  added).22  In  other  words,  Space 
Shuttle  Program  personnel  knew  that  the  monitoring  of 
tile damage was inadequate and that clear trends could be 
more readily identified if monitoring was improved, but no 
such improvements were made. The Board also noted that 
an STS-27R investigation team recommendation correlated 
to the Columbia accident 14 years later: “It is recommended 
that  the  program  actively  solicit  design  improvements  di-
rected  toward  eliminating  debris  sources  or  minimizing 
damage potential.”23

Another  instance  of  non-bipod  foam  damage  occurred  on 
STS-35. Post-flight inspections of Columbia after STS-35 in 
December 1990, showed a higher-than-average amount of 
damage on the Orbiterʼs lower surface. A review of External 
Tank  separation  film  revealed  approximately  10  areas  of 
missing foam on the flange connecting the liquid hydrogen 

tank to the intertank. An In-Flight Anomaly was assigned 
to the External Tank Project, which closed it by stating that 
there was no increase in Orbiter Thermal Protection System 
damage  and  that  it  was  “not  a  safety-of-flight  concern.”24 
The Board notes that it was in a discussion at the STS-36 
Flight  Readiness  Review  that  NASA  first  identified  this 
problem as a turnaround issue.25 Per established procedures, 
NASA  was  still  designating  foam-loss  events  as  In-Flight 
Anomalies  and  continued  to  make  various  corrective  ac-
tions, such as drilling more vent holes and improving the 
foam application process.

Discovery was launched on STS-42 on January 22, 1992. A 
total of 159 hits on the Orbiter Thermal Protection System 
were noted after landing. Two 8- to 12-inch-diameter div-
ots in the External Tank intertank area were noted during 
post-External Tank separation photo evaluation, and these 
pieces of foam were identified as the most probable sources 
of the damage. The External Tank Project was assigned an

In-Flight Anomaly, and the incident was later described as 
an unexplained or isolated event. However, at later Flight 
Readiness  Reviews,  the  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center 
briefed this as being “not a safety-of-flight” concern.26 The 
next flight, STS-45, would be the first mission launched be-
fore the foam-loss In-Flight Anomaly was closed. 

On  March  24,  1992,  Atlantis  was  launched  on  STS-45. 
Post-mission inspection revealed exposed substrate on the 
upper surface of right wing leading edge Reinforced Car-
bon-Carbon (RCC) panel 10 caused by two gouges, one 1.9 
inches by 1.6 inches and the other 0.4 inches by 1 inch.27 
Before  the  next  flight,  an  In-Flight Anomaly  assigned  to 
the Orbiter Project was closed as “unexplained,” but “most 
likely orbital debris.”28 Despite this closure, the Safety and 
Mission Assurance Office expressed concern as late as the 
pre-launch  Mission  Management  Team  meeting  two  days 
before the launch of STS-49. Nevertheless, the mission was 
cleared for launch. Later laboratory tests identified pieces 
of man-made debris lodged in the RCC, including stainless 
steel, aluminum, and titanium, but no conclusion was made 
about the source of the debris. (The Board notes that this 
indicates there were transport mechanisms available to de-
termine the path the debris took to impact the wing leading 
edge. See Section 3.4.)

The Program Requirements Control Board also assigned the 
External Tank Project an In-Flight Anomaly after foam loss 
on  STS-56  (Discovery)  and  STS-58  (Columbia),  both  of 
which were launched in 1993. These missions demonstrate 
the increasingly casual ways in which debris impacts were 
dispositioned  by  Shuttle  Program  managers.  After  post-
flight analysis determined that on both missions the foam 
had come from the intertank and bipod jackpad areas, the 
rationale for closing the In-Flight Anomalies included nota-
tions that the External Tank foam debris was “in-family,” or 
within the experience base.29

During the launch of STS-87 (Columbia) on November 19, 
1997,  a  debris  event  focused  NASAʼs  attention  on  debris-
shedding  and  damage  to  the  Orbiter.  Post-External  Tank 
separation photography revealed a significant loss of mate-
rial from both thrust panels, which are fastened to the Solid 
Rocket Booster forward attachment points on the intertank 
structure. Post-landing inspection of the Orbiter noted 308 
hits, with 244 on the lower surface and 109 larger than an 
inch. The foam loss from the External Tank thrust panels was 
suspected as the most probable cause of the Orbiter Thermal 
Protection System damage. Based on data from post-flight 
inspection  reports,  as  well  as  comparisons  with  statistics 
from  71  similarly  configured  flights,  the  total  number  of 
damage sites, and the number of damage sites one inch or 
larger,  were  considered  “out-of-family.”30 An  investigation 
was conducted to determine the cause of the material loss 
and the actions required to prevent a recurrence. 

The foam loss problem on STS-87 was described as “pop-
corning” because of the numerous popcorn-size foam par-
ticles that came off the thrust panels. Popcorning has always 
occurred,  but  it  began  earlier  than  usual  in  the  launch  of 
STS-87.  The  cause  of  the  earlier-than-normal  popcorning 
(but not the fundamental cause of popcorning) was traced 

back to a change in foam-blowing agents that caused pres-
sure buildups and stress concentrations within the foam. In 
an effort to reduce its use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
NASA  had  switched  from  a  CFC-11  (chlorofluorocarbon) 
blowing agent to an HCFC-141b blowing agent beginning 
with External Tank-85, which was assigned to STS-84. (The 
change in blowing agent affected only mechanically applied 
foam. Foam that is hand sprayed, such as on the bipod ramp, 
is still applied using CFC-11.)

The Program Requirements Control Board issued a Direc-
tive and the External Tank Project was assigned an In-Flight 
Anomaly  to  address  the  intertank  thrust  panel  foam  loss. 
Over the course of nine missions, the External Tank Project 
first reduced the thickness of the foam on the thrust panels 
to minimize the amount of foam that could be shed; and, 
due  to  a  misunderstanding  of  what  caused  foam  loss  at 
that time, put vent holes in the thrust panel foam to relieve 
trapped gas pressure. 

The In-Flight Anomaly remained open during these changes, 
and foam shedding occurred on the nine missions that tested 
the corrective actions. Following STS-101, the 10th mission 
after  STS-87,  the  Program  Requirements  Control  Board 
concluded  that  foam-shedding  from  the  thrust  panel  had 
been reduced to an “acceptable level” by sanding and vent-
ing,  and  the  In-Flight Anomaly  was  closed.31 The  Orbiter 
Project, External Tank Project, and Space Shuttle Program 
management  all  accepted  this  rationale  without  question. 
The  Board  notes  that  these  interventions  merely  reduced 
foam-shedding to previously experienced levels, which have 
remained relatively constant over the Shuttleʼs lifetime.

Making the Orbiter More Resistant To Debris Strikes

If foam shedding could not be prevented entirely, what did 
NASA  do  to  make  the  Thermal  Protection  System  more 
resistant  to  debris  strikes? A  1990  study  by  Dr.  Elisabeth 
Paté-Cornell  and  Paul  Fishback  attempted  to  quantify  the 
risk of a Thermal Protection System failure using probabilis-
tic analysis.32 The data they used included (1) the probability 
that a tile would become debonded by either debris strikes or 
a poor bond, (2) the probability of then losing adjacent tiles, 
(3) depending on the final size of the failed area, the prob-
ability of burn-through, and (4) the probability of failure of 
a critical sub-system if burn-through occurs. The study con-
cluded that the probability of losing an Orbiter on any given 
mission due to a failure of Thermal Protection System tiles 
was  approximately  one  in  1,000.  Debris-related  problems 
accounted for approximately 40 percent of the probability, 
while 60 percent was attributable to tile debonding caused 
by other factors. An estimated 85 percent of the risk could 
be attributed to 15 percent of the “acreage,” or larger areas 
of tile, meaning that the loss of any one of a relatively small 
number of tiles pose a relatively large amount of risk to the 
Orbiter. In other words, not all tiles are equal – losing certain 
tiles is more dangerous. While the actual risk may be differ-
ent than that computed in the 1990 study due to the limited 
amount of data and the underlying simplified assumptions, 
this type of analysis offers insight that enables management 
to  concentrate  their  resources  on  protecting  the  Orbitersʼ 
critical areas.

Two years after the conclusion of that study, NASA wrote 
to  Paté-Cornell  and  Fishback  describing  the  importance 
of  their  work,  and  stated  that  it  was  developing  a  long-
term effort to use probabilistic risk assessment and related 
disciplines  to  improve  programmatic  decisions.33  Though 
NASA has taken some measures to invest in probabilistic 
risk assessment as a tool, it is the Boardʼs view that NASA 
has not fully exploited the insights that Paté-Cornellʼs and 
Fishbackʼs work offered.34 

Impact Resistant Tile

NASA also evaluated the possibility of increasing Thermal 
Protection System tile resistance to debris hits, lowering the 
possibility of tile debonding, and reducing tile production 
and maintenance costs.35 Indeed, tiles with a “tough” coat-
ing are currently used on the Orbiters. This coating, known 
as  Toughened  Uni-piece  Fibrous  Insulation  (TUFI),  was 
patented in 1992 and developed for use on high-temperature 
rigid insulation.36 TUFI is used on a tile material known as 
Alumina Enhanced Thermal Barrier (AETB), and has a de-
bris impact resistance that is greater than the current acreage 
tileʼs resistance by a factor of approximately 6-20.37 At least 
772 of these advanced tiles have been installed on the Orbit-
ersʼ base heat shields and upper body flaps.38 However, due 
to its higher thermal conductivity, TUFI-coated AETB can-
not be used as a replacement for the larger areas of tile cov-
erage. (Boeing, Lockheed Martin and NASA are developing 
a  lightweight,  impact-resistant,  low-conductivity  tile.39) 
Because the impact requirements for these next-generation 
tiles do not appear to be based on resistance to specific (and 
probable) damage sources, it is the Boardʼs view that certifi-
cation of the new tile will not adequately address the threat 
posed by debris.

Conclusion

Despite original design requirements that the External Tank 
not shed debris, and the corresponding design requirement 
that the Orbiter not receive debris hits exceeding a trivial 
amount of force, debris has impacted the Shuttle on each 
flight. Over the course of 113 missions, foam-shedding and 
other debris impacts came to be regarded more as a turn-
around  or  maintenance  issue,  and  less  as  a  hazard  to  the 
vehicle and crew. 

Assessments  of  foam-shedding  and  strikes  were  not  thor-
oughly substantiated by engineering analysis, and the pro-
cess for closing In-Flight Anomalies is not well-documented 
and  appears  to  vary.  Shuttle  Program  managers  appear  to 
have confused the notion of foam posing an “accepted risk” 
with foam not being a “safety-of-flight issue.” At times, the 
pressure to meet the flight schedule appeared to cut short 
engineering efforts to resolve the foam-shedding problem.

NASAʼs lack of understanding of foam properties and be-
havior must also be questioned. Although tests were con-
ducted to develop and qualify foam for use on the External 
Tank, it appears there were large gaps in NASAʼs knowledge 
about  this  complex  and  variable  material.  Recent  testing 
conducted  at  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  and  under  the 
auspices of the Board indicate that mechanisms previously 

considered a prime source of foam loss, cryopumping and 
cryoingestion, are not feasible in the conditions experienced 
during tanking, launch, and ascent. Also, dissections of foam 
bipod ramps on External Tanks yet to be launched reveal 
subsurface flaws and defects that only now are being discov-
ered and identified as contributing to the loss of foam from 
the bipod ramps.

While NASA properly designated key debris events as In-
Flight Anomalies  in  the  past,  more  recent  events  indicate 
that  NASA  engineers  and  management  did  not  appreciate 
the scope, or lack of scope, of the Hazard Reports involv-
ing foam shedding.40 Ultimately, NASAʼs hazard analyses, 
which  were  based  on  reducing  or  eliminating  foam-shed-
ding,  were  not  succeeding.  Shuttle  Program  management 
made no adjustments to the analyses to recognize this fact. 
The acceptance of events that are not supposed to happen 
has  been  described  by  sociologist  Diane  Vaughan  as  the 
“normalization of deviance.”41 The history of foam-problem 
decisions shows how NASA first began and then continued 
flying with foam losses, so that flying with these deviations 
from  design  specifications  was  viewed  as  normal  and  ac-
ceptable. Dr. Richard Feynman, a member of the Presiden-
tial Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, 
discusses this phenomena in the context of the Challenger 
accident. The parallels are striking:

The phenomenon of accepting … flight seals that had 
shown erosion and blow-by in previous flights is very 
clear.  The  Challenger  flight  is  an  excellent  example. 
There are several references to flights that had gone be-
fore. The acceptance and success of these flights is taken 
as evidence of safety. But erosions and blow-by are not 
what the design expected. They are warnings that some-
thing is wrong … The O-rings of the Solid Rocket Boost-
ers were not designed to erode. Erosion was a clue that 
something was wrong. Erosion was not something from 
which safety can be inferred … If a reasonable launch 
schedule is to be maintained, engineering often cannot 
be done fast enough to keep up with the expectations of 
originally  conservative  certification  criteria  designed 
to  guarantee  a  very  safe  vehicle.  In  these  situations, 
subtly, and often with apparently logical arguments, the 
criteria are altered so that flights may still be certified in 
time. They therefore fly in a relatively unsafe condition, 
with a chance of failure of the order of a percent (it is 
difficult to be more accurate).42 

Findings

F6.1−2 

F6.1−1  NASA has not followed its own rules and require-
ments  on  foam-shedding.  Although  the  agency 
continuously  worked  on 
the  foam-shedding 
problem, the debris impact requirements have not 
been met on any mission.
Foam-shedding,  which  had  initially  raised  seri-
ous safety concerns, evolved into “in-family” or 
“no  safety-of-flight”  events  or  were  deemed  an 
“accepted risk.”
Five  of  the  seven  bipod  ramp  events  occurred 
on  missions  flown  by  Columbia,  a  seemingly 
high  number.  This  observation  is  likely  due  to

Columbia having been equipped with umbilical 
cameras earlier than other Orbiters.
There is lack of effective processes for feedback 
or integration among project elements in the reso-
lution of In-Flight Anomalies.
Foam bipod debris-shedding incidents on STS-52 
and STS-62 were undetected at the time they oc-
curred, and were not discovered until the Board 
directed NASA to examine External Tank separa-
tion images more closely.
Foam  bipod  debris-shedding  events  were  clas-
sified as In-Flight Anomalies up until STS-112, 
which was the first known bipod foam-shedding 
event not classified as an In-Flight Anomaly. 
The STS-112 assignment for the External Tank 
Project to “identify the cause and corrective ac-
tion of the bipod ramp foam loss event” was not 
due  until  after  the  planned  launch  of  STS-113, 
and then slipped to after the launch of STS-107.

F6.1−8  No  External  Tank  configuration  changes  were 

made after the bipod foam loss on STS-112.

F6.1−9  Although it is sometimes possible to obtain imag-
ery of night launches because of light provided by 
the Solid Rocket Motor plume, no imagery was 
obtained for STS-113.

F6.1−10  NASA failed to adequately perform trend analy-
sis  on  foam  losses.  This  greatly  hampered  the 
agencyʼs  ability  to  make  informed  decisions 
about foam losses.

F6.1−11  Despite the constant shedding of foam, the Shut-
tle Program did little to harden the Orbiter against 
foam  impacts  through  upgrades  to  the Thermal 
Protection  System.  Without  impact  resistance 
and strength requirements that are calibrated to 
the energy of debris likely to impact the Orbiter, 
certification  of  new Thermal  Protection  System 
tile will not adequately address the threat posed 
by debris.

6.2  SCHEDULE PRESSURE

Countdown to Space Station “Core Complete:” A 
Workforce Under Pressure

During the course of this investigation, the Board received 
several unsolicited comments from NASA personnel regard-
ing pressure to meet a schedule. These comments all con-
cerned a date, more than a year after the launch of Columbia, 
that seemed etched in stone: February 19, 2004, the sched-
uled launch date of STS-120. This flight was a milestone in 
the minds of NASA management since it would carry a sec-
tion of the International Space Station called “Node 2.” This 
would configure the International Space Station to its “U.S. 
Core Complete” status.

At  first  glance,  the  Core  Complete  configuration  date 
seemed noteworthy but unrelated to the Columbia accident. 
However, as the investigation continued, it became apparent 

that the complexity and political mandates surrounding the 
International Space Station Program, as well as Shuttle Pro-
gram managementʼs responses to them, resulted in pressure 
to meet an increasingly ambitious launch schedule. 

In mid-2001, NASA adopted plans to make the over-budget 
and behind-schedule International Space Station credible to 
the White House and Congress. The Space Station Program 
and NASA were on probation, and had to prove they could 
meet schedules and budgets. The plan to regain credibility fo-
cused on the February 19, 2004, date for the launch of Node 
2 and the resultant Core Complete status. If this goal was not 
met, NASA would risk losing support from the White House 
and Congress for subsequent Space Station growth. 

By the late summer of 2002, a variety of problems caused 
Space Station assembly work and Shuttle flights to slip be-
yond  their  target  dates. With  the  Node  2  launch  endpoint 
fixed, these delays caused the schedule to become ever more 
compressed. 

Meeting U.S. Core Complete by February 19, 2004, would 
require preparing and launching 10 flights in less than 16 
months. With the focus on retaining support for the Space 
Station program, little attention was paid to the effects the 
aggressive Node 2 launch date would have on the Shuttle 
Program. After years of downsizing and budget cuts (Chapter 
5), this mandate and events in the months leading up to STS-
107 introduced elements of risk to the Program. Columbia 
and the STS-107 crew, who had seen numerous launch slips 
due  to  missions  that  were  deemed  higher  priorities,  were 
further affected by the mandatory Core Complete date. The 
high-pressure environments created by NASA Headquarters 
unquestionably affected Columbia, even though it was not 
flying to the International Space Station. 

February 19, 2004 – “A Line in the Sand”

Schedules are essential tools that help large organizations 
effectively manage their resources. Aggressive schedules by 
themselves are often a sign of a healthy institution. How-
ever,  other  institutional  goals,  such  as  safety,  sometimes 
compete  with  schedules,  so  the  effects  of  schedule  pres-
sure  in  an  organization  must  be  carefully  monitored. The 
Board posed the question: Was there undue pressure to nail 
the Node 2 launch date to the February 19, 2004, signpost? 
The management and workforce of the Shuttle and Space 
Station  programs  each  answered  the  question  differently. 
Various members of NASA upper management gave a defi-
nite “no.” In contrast, the workforce within both programs 
thought there was considerable management focus on Node 
2 and resulting pressure to hold firm to that launch date, and 
individuals were becoming concerned that safety might be 
compromised. The weight of evidence supports the work-
force view.

Employees  attributed  the  Node  2  launch  date  to  the  new 
Administrator, Sean OʼKeefe, who was appointed to execute 
a Space Station management plan he had proposed as Dep-
uty Director of the White House Office of Management and 
Budget. They understood the scrutiny that NASA, the new 
Administrator, and the Space Station Program were under,

but now it seemed to some that budget and schedule were of 
paramount concern. As one employee reflected:

I guess my frustration was … I know the importance of 
showing that you … manage your budget and thatʼs an 
important impression to make to Congress so you can 
continue the future of the agency, but to a lot of people, 
February  19th  just  seemed  like  an  arbitrary  date  … 
It doesnʼt make sense to me why at all costs we were 
marching to this date.

The importance of this date was stressed from the very top. 
The  Space  Shuttle  and  Space  Station  Program  Managers 
briefed the new NASA Administrator monthly on the status 
of their programs, and a significant part of those briefings 
was  the  days  of  margin  remaining  in  the  schedule  to  the 
launch of Node 2 – still well over a year away. The Node 2 
schedule margin typically accounted for more than half of 
the briefing slides.

Figure 6.2-1 is one of the charts presented by the Shuttle 
Program Manager to the NASA Administrator in December 
2002. The chart shows how the days of margin in the exist-
ing schedule were being managed to meet the requirement 

of  a  Node  2  launch  on  the  prescribed  date. The  triangles 
are events that affected the schedule (such as the slip of a 
Russian  Soyuz  flight).  The  squares  indicate  action  taken 
by management to regain the lost time (such as authorizing 
work over the 2002 winter holidays).

Figure 6.2-2 shows a slide from the International Space Sta-
tion Program Managerʼs portion of the briefing. It indicates 
that International Space Station Program management was 
also taking actions to regain margin. Over the months, the 
extent of some testing at Kennedy was reduced, the number 
of tasks done in parallel was increased, and a third shift of 
workers would be added in 2003 to accomplish the process-
ing. These charts illustrate that both the Space Shuttle and 
Space Station Programs were being managed to a particular 
launch  date  –  February  19,  2004.  Days  of  margin  in  that 
schedule were one of the principle metrics by which both 
programs came to be judged.

NASA Headquarters stressed the importance of this date in 
other ways. A screen saver (see Figure 6.2-3) was mailed 
to  managers  in  NASAʼs  human  spaceflight  program  that 
depicted a clock counting down to February 19, 2004 – U.S. 
Core Complete.

While employees found this amusing because they saw it as 
a date that could not be met, it also reinforced the message 
that NASA Headquarters was focused on and promoting the 
achievement of that date. This schedule was on the minds of 
the Shuttle managers in the months leading up to STS-107. 

The Background: Schedule Complexity and 
Compression

In 2001, the International Space Station Cost and Manage-
ment  Evaluation  Task  Force  report  recommended,  as  a 
cost-saving measure, a limit of four Shuttle flights to the In-
ternational Space Station per year. To meet this requirement, 
managers began adjusting the Shuttle and Station manifests 
to  “get  back  in  the  budget  box.” They  rearranged  Station 
assembly  sequences,  moving  some  elements  forward  and 
taking others out. When all was said and done, the launch 
of STS-120, which would carry Node 2 to the International 
Space Station, fell on February 19, 2004.

The  Core  Complete  date  simply  emerged  from  this  plan-
ning effort in 2001. By all accounts, it was a realistic and 
achievable date when first approved. At the time there was 
more concern that four Shuttle flights a year would limit the

sonable goal and assumed that if circumstances warranted a 
slip of that date, it would be granted. 

Shuttle and Station managers worked diligently to meet the 
schedule. Events gradually ate away at the schedule margin. 
Unlike the “old days” before the Station, the Station/Shuttle 
partnership  created  problems  that  had  a  ripple  effect  on 
both  programsʼ  manifests. As  one  employee  described  it, 
“the serial nature” of having to fly Space Station assembly 
missions in a specific order made staying on schedule more 
challenging. Before the Space Station, if a Shuttle flight had 
to slip, it would; other missions that had originally followed 
it would be launched in the meantime. Missions could be 
flown in any sequence. Now the manifests were a delicate 
balancing act. Missions had to be flown in a certain order 
and were constrained by the availability of the launch site, 
the Russian Soyuz and Progress schedules, and a myriad of 
other processes. As a result, employees stated they were now 
experiencing a new kind of pressure. Any necessary change 
they made on one mission was now impacting future launch 
dates. They had a sense of being “under the gun.”

Shuttle and Station program personnel ended up with mani-
fests that one employee described as “changing, changing, 
changing” all the time. One of the biggest issues they faced 
entering 2002 was “up mass,” the amount of cargo the Shut-
tle can carry to the Station. Up mass was not a new problem, 
but when the Shuttle flight rate was reduced to four per year, 
up  mass  became  critical.  Working  groups  were  actively 
evaluating options in the summer of 2002 and bartering to 
get each flight to function as expected. 

Sometimes the up mass being traded was actual Space Sta-
tion crew members. A crew rotation planned for STS-118 
was moved to a later flight because STS-118 was needed for 
other cargo. This resulted in an increase of crew duration on 
the Space Station, which was creeping past the 180-day limit 
agreed to by the astronaut office, flight surgeons, and Space 
Station  international  partners. A  space  station  worker  de-
scribed how this one change created many other problems, 
and added: “… we had a train wreck coming …” Future on-
orbit crew time was being projected at 205 days or longer to 
maintain the assembly sequence and meet the schedule. 

By July 2002, the Shuttle and Space Station Programs were 
facing a schedule with very little margin. Two setbacks oc-
curred when technical problems were found during routine 
maintenance on Discovery. STS-107 was four weeks away 
from  launch  at  the  time,  but  the  problems  grounded  the 
entire Shuttle fleet. The longer the fleet was grounded, the 
more schedule margin was lost, which further compounded 
the complexity of the intertwined Shuttle and Station sched-
ules. As one worker described the situation: 

…  a one-week hit on a particular launch can start a 
steam  roll  effect  including  all  [the]  constraints  and 
by the time you get out of here, that one-week slip has 
turned into a couple of months.

a Space Station flight, so the other three Orbiters flew the 
Station missions. But Discovery was in its Orbiter Mainte-
nance Down Period, and would not be available for another 
17 months. All Space Station flights until then would have 
to be made by Atlantis and Endeavour. As managers looked 
ahead to 2003, they saw that after STS-107, these two Orbit-
ers would have to alternate flying five consecutive missions, 
STS-114 through STS-118. To alleviate this pressure, and 
regain schedule margin, Shuttle Program managers elected 
to modify Columbia to enable it to fly Space Station mis-
sions. Those modifications were to take place immediately 
after STS-107 so that Columbia would be ready to fly its first 
Space Station mission eight months later. This decision put 
Columbia directly in the path of Core Complete.

As the autumn of 2002 began, both the Space Shuttle and 
Space Station Programs began to use what some employ-
ees termed “tricks” to regain schedule margin. Employees 
expressed concern that their ability to gain schedule margin 
using existing measures was waning.

In September 2002, it was clear to Space Shuttle and Space 
Station Program managers that they were not going to meet 
the schedule as it was laid out. The two Programs proposed a 
new set of launch dates, documented in an e-mail (right) that 
included moving STS-120, the Node 2 flight, to mid-March 
2004. (Note that the first paragraph ends with “… the 10A 
[U.S. Core Complete, Node 2] launch remains 2/19/04.”)

These  launch  date  changes  made  it  possible  to  meet  the 
early  part  of  the  schedule,  but  compressed  the  late  2003/
early 2004 schedule even further. This did not make sense 
to many in the program. One described the system as at “an 
uncomfortable point,” noted having to go to great lengths to 
reduce vehicle-processing time at Kennedy, and added:

…  I  donʼt  know  what  Congress  communicated  to 
OʼKeefe.  I  donʼt  really  understand  the  criticality  of 
February 19th, that if we didnʼt make that date, did that 
mean the end of NASA? I donʼt know … I would like to 
think that the technical issues and safely resolving the 
technical issues can take priority over any budget issue 
or scheduling issue.

When the Shuttle fleet was cleared to return to flight, atten-
tion turned to STS-112, STS-113, and STS-107, set for Oc-
tober, November, and January. Workers were uncomfortable 
with the rapid sequence of flights.

The  thing  that  was  beginning  to  concern  me  …  is  I 
wasnʼt convinced that people were being given enough 
time to work the problems correctly.

The problems that had grounded the fleet had been handled 
well, but the program nevertheless lost the rest of its margin. 
As the pressure to keep to the Node 2 schedule continued, 
some  were  concerned  that  this  might  influence  the  future 
handling of problems. One worker expressed the concern: 

In August 2002, the Shuttle Program realized it would be 
unable to meet the Space Station schedule with the avail-
able Shuttles. Columbia had never been outfitted to make 

…  and  I  have  to  think  that  subconsciously  that  even 
though you donʼt want it to affect decision-making, it 
probably does.

The ISS and SSP Program Managers have agreed to proceed with the crew rotation change and the 
following date changes: 12A launch to 5/23/03, 12A.1 launch to 7/24/03, 13A launch to 10/2/03, and 
13A.1 launch to NET 11/13/03. Please note that 10A launch remains 2/19/04. 

The ISS SSCN that requests evaluation of these changes will be released Monday morning after the 
NASA/Russian bilateral Requirements and Increment Planning videocon. It will contain the following:

•  Increments 8 and 9 redefinition - this includes baseline of ULF2 into the tactical timeframe as the 

new return flight for Expedition 9

•  Crew size changes for 7S, 13A.1, 15A, and 10A
•  Shuttle date changes as listed above
•  Russian date changes for CY2003 that were removed from SSCN 6872 (11P launch/10P undock 

and subsequent)

•  CY2004 Russian data if available Monday morning
•  Duration changes for 12A and 15A
•  Docking altitude update for 10A, along with “NET” TBR closure. 

The evaluation due date is 10/2/02. Board/meeting dates are as follows: MIOCB status - 10/3/02; 
comment dispositioning - 10/3/02 FPWG (meeting date/time under review); OA/MA Program Man-
agers status - 10/4/02; SSPCB and JPRCB - 10/8/02; MMIOCB status (under review) and SSCB 
- 10/10/02.

The 13A.1 date is indicated as “NET” (No Earlier Than) since SSP ability to meet that launch date is 
under review due to the processing flow requirements.

There is no longer a backup option to move ULF2 to OV-105: due to vehicle processing requirements, 
there is no launch opportunity on OV-105 past May 2004 until after OMM.

The Program Managers have asked for preparation of a backup plan in case of a schedule slip of 
ULF2. In order to accomplish this, the projected ISS upmass capability shortfall will be calculated as 
if ULF2 launch were 10/7/04, and a recommendation made for addressing the resulting shortfall and 
increment durations. Some methods to be assessed: manifest restructuring, fallback moves of rota-
tion flight launch dates, LON (Launch on Need) flight on 4/29/04.

This  was  the  environment  for  October  and  November  of 
2002. During this time, a bipod foam event occurred on STS-
112. For the first time in the history of the Shuttle Program, 
the Program Requirements Control Board chose to classify 
that bipod foam loss as an “action” rather than a more seri-
ous  In-Flight Anomaly. At  the  STS-113  Flight  Readiness 
Review, managers accepted with little question the rationale 
that it was safe to fly with the known foam problem. 

The Operations Tempo Following STS-107

After STS-107, the tempo was only going to increase. The 
vehicle processing schedules, training schedules, and mission 
control flight staffing assignments were all overburdened.

The  vehicle-processing  schedule  for  flights  from  February 
2003, through February 2004, was optimistic. The schedule

could not be met with only two shifts of workers per day. In 
late 2002, NASA Headquarters approved plans to hire a third 
shift. There were four Shuttle launches to the Space Station 
scheduled in the five months from October 2003, through the 
launch of Node 2 in February 2004. To put this in perspec-
tive, the launch rate in 1985, for which NASA was criticized 
by the Rogers Commission, was nine flights in 12 months 
– and that was accomplished with four Orbiters and a mani-
fest that was not complicated by Space Station assembly.

Endeavour was the Orbiter on the critical path. Figure 6.2-4
shows  the  schedule  margin  for  STS-115,  STS-117,  and 
STS-120 (Node 2). To preserve the margin going into 2003, 
the vehicle processing team would be required to work the 
late  2002-early  2003  winter  holidays.  The  third  shift  of 
workers  at  Kennedy  would  be  available  in  March  2003, 
and would buy eight more days of margin for STS-117 and 
STS-120. The workforce would likely have to work on the 
2003 winter holidays to meet the Node 2 date. 

left to right) vehicle processing margin, holiday margin, and 
Dryden  margin.  The  vehicle  processing  margin  indicates 
how many days there are in addition to the days required for 
that missionʼs vehicle processing. Endeavour (OV-105) had 
zero days of margin for the processing flows for STS-115, 
STS-117, and STS-120. The holiday margin is the number 
of  days  that  could  be  gained  by  working  holidays.  The 
Dryden margin is the six days that are always reserved to 
accommodate an Orbiter landing at Edwards Air Force Base 
in  California  and  having  to  be  ferried  to  Kennedy.  If  the 
Orbiter landed at Kennedy, those six days would automati-
cally be regained. Note that the Dryden margin had already 
been surrendered in the STS-114 and STS-115 schedules. If 
bad weather at Kennedy forced those two flights to land at 
Edwards, the schedule would be directly affected. 

The clear message in these charts is that any technical prob-
lem that resulted in a slip to one launch would now directly 
affect the Node 2 launch.

OV-103,  was  in  extended  maintenance).  The  large  boxes

refurbishment is performed in the three Orbiter Processing 
Facilities at Kennedy. One was occupied by Discovery dur-
ing  its  scheduled  extended  maintenance.  This  left  two  to 
serve the other three Orbiters over the next several months. 
The 2003 schedule indicated plans to move Columbia (after 
its return from STS-107) from an Orbiter Processing Facility 
to the Vehicle Assembly Building and back several times in 
order to make room for Atlantis (OV-104) and Endeavour 
(OV-105) and prepare them for missions. Moving an Orbiter 
is  tedious,  time-consuming,  carefully  orchestrated  work. 
Each move introduces an opportunity for problems. Those 
2003 moves were often slated to occur without a day of mar-
gin between them – another indication of the additional risks 
that managers were willing to incur to meet the schedule.

The effect of the compressed schedule was also evident in 
the Mission Operations Directorate. The plans for flight con-
troller staffing of Mission Control showed that of the seven 
flight  controllers  who  lacked  current  certifications  during 
STS-107 (see Chapter 4), five were scheduled to work the 
next  mission,  and  three  were  scheduled  to  work  the  next 
three  missions  (STS-114,  -115,  and  -116).  These  control-
lers would have been constantly either supporting missions 
or supporting mission training, and were unlikely to have 

the time to complete the recertification requirements. With 
the pressure of the schedule, the things perceived to be less 
important, like recertification (which was not done before 
STS-107), would likely continue to be deferred. As a result 
of the schedule pressure, managers either were willing to de-
lay recertification or were too busy to notice that deadlines 
for recertification had passed.

Columbia: Caught in the Middle

STS-112  flew  in  October  2002.  At  33  seconds  into  the 
flight,  a  piece  of  the  bipod  foam  from  the  External Tank 
struck one of the Solid Rocket Boosters. As described in 
Section  6.1,  the  STS-112  foam  strike  was  discussed  at 
the  Program  Requirements  Control  Board  following  the 
flight.  Although  the  initial  recommendation  was  to  treat 
the foam loss as an In-Flight Anomaly, the Shuttle Program 
instead assigned it as an action, with a due date after the 
next launch. (This was the first instance of bipod foam loss 
that was not designated an In-Flight Anomaly.) The action 
was noted at the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review. Those 
Flight Readiness Review charts (see Section 6.1) provided 
a flawed flight rationale by concluding that the foam loss 
was “not a safety-of-flight” issue.

Interestingly, during Columbiaʼs mission, the Chair of the 
Mission Management Team, Linda Ham, would characterize 
that reasoning as “lousy” – though neither she nor Shuttle 
Program Manager Ron Dittemore, who were both present at 
the meeting, questioned it at the time. The pressing need to 
launch STS-113 to retrieve the International Space Station 
Expedition 5 crew before they surpassed the 180-day limit 
and to continue the countdown to Node 2 were surely in the 
back of managersʼ minds during these reviews.

By  December  2002,  every  bit  of  padding  in  the  schedule 
had disappeared. Another chart from the Shuttle and Station 
Program  Managersʼ  briefing  to  the  NASA  Administrator 
summarizes the schedule dilemma (see Figure 6.2-6).

Even with work scheduled on holidays, a third shift of work-
ers  being  hired  and  trained,  future  crew  rotations  drifting 
beyond  180  days,  and  some  tests  previously  deemed  “re-
quirements” being skipped or deferred, Program managers 
estimated that Node 2 launch would be one to two months 
late. They were slowly accepting additional risk in trying to 
meet a schedule that probably could not be met.

Interviews with workers provided insight into how this situ-
ation occurred. They noted that people who work at NASA 
have the legendary can-do attitude, which contributes to the 
agencyʼs successes. But it can also cause problems. When 
workers are asked to find days of margin, they work furious-
ly to do so and are praised for each extra day they find. But 

those  same  people  (and  this  same  culture)  have  difficulty 
admitting  that  something  “canʼt”  or  “shouldnʼt”  be  done, 
that the margin has been cut too much, or that resources are 
being stretched too thin. No one at NASA wants to be the 
one to stand up and say, “We canʼt make that date.”

STS-107  was  launched  on  January  16,  2003.  Bipod  foam 
separated from the External Tank and struck Columbiaʼs left 
wing  81.9  seconds  after  liftoff. As  the  mission  proceeded 
over  the  next  16  days,  critical  decisions  about  that  event 
would be made.

The  STS-107  Mission  Management  Team  Chair,  Linda 
Ham, had been present at the Program Requirements Control 
Board discussing the STS-112 foam loss and the STS-113 
Flight Readiness Review. So had many of the other Shuttle 
Program managers who had roles in STS-107. Ham was also 
the Launch Integration Manager for the next mission, STS-
114. In that capacity, she would chair many of the meetings 
leading up to the launch of that flight, and many of those 
individuals would have to confront Columbiaʼs foam strike 
and its possible impact on the launch of STS-114. Would the 
Columbia foam strike be classified as an In-Flight Anomaly? 
Would the fact that foam had detached from the bipod ramp 
on two out of the last three flights have made this problem a 
constraint to flight that would need to be solved before the 
next launch? Could the Program develop a solid rationale 
to fly STS-114, or would additional analysis be required to 
clear the flight for launch?

DITTEMORE, RONALD D. (JSC-MA) (NASA)
RE: ET Briefing - STS-112 Foam Loss

Yes, I remember....It was not good. I told Jerry to address it at the ORR next Tuesday (even though 
he won’t have any more data and it really doesn’t impact Orbiter roll to the VAB). I just want him to be 
thinking hard about this now, not wait until IFA review to get a formal action.

[ORR=Orbiter Rollout Review, VAB=Vehicle Assembly Building, IFA=In-Flight Anomaly]

In  fact,  most  of  Linda  Hamʼs  inquiries  about  the  foam 
strike  were  not  to  determine  what  action  to  take  during 
Columbiaʼs mission, but to understand the implications for 
STS-114. During a Mission Management Team meeting on 
January 21, she asked about the rationale put forward at the 
STS-113 Flight Readiness Review, which she had attended. 
Later  that  morning  she  reviewed  the  charts  presented  at 
that  Flight  Readiness  Review.  Her  assessment,  which  she 
e-mailed  to  Shuttle  Program  Manager  Ron  Dittemore  on 
January 21, was “Rationale was lousy then and still is …” 
(See Section 6.3 for the e-mail.)

One of Hamʼs STS-114 duties was to chair a review to deter-
mine if the missionʼs Orbiter, Atlantis, should be rolled from 
the  Orbiter  Processing  Facility  to  the  Vehicle  Assembly 
Building, per its pre-launch schedule. In the above e-mail to 
Ron Dittemore, Ham indicates a desire to have the same in-
dividual responsible for the “lousy” STS-113 flight rationale 
start  working  the  foam  shedding  issue  –  and  presumably 
present a new flight rationale – very soon.

As STS-107 prepared for re-entry, Shuttle Program manag-
ers  prepared  for  STS-114  flight  rationale  by  arranging  to 
have post-flight photographs taken of Columbiaʼs left wing 
rushed to Johnson Space Center for analysis. 

As will become clear in the next section, most of the Shuttle 
Programʼs concern about Columbiaʼs foam strike were not 
about  the  threat  it  might  pose  to  the  vehicle  in  orbit,  but 
about the threat it might pose to the schedule.

Conclusion

The  agencyʼs  commitment  to  hold  firm  to  a  February  19, 
2004, launch date for Node 2 influenced many of decisions 
in the months leading up to the launch of STS-107, and may 
well have subtly influenced the way managers handled the 
STS-112 foam strike and Columbiaʼs as well.

When a program agrees to spend less money or accelerate 
a  schedule  beyond  what  the  engineers  and  program  man-
agers think is reasonable, a small amount of overall risk is 
added. These little pieces of risk add up until managers are 
no longer aware of the total program risk, and are, in fact, 
gambling.  Little  by  little,  NASA  was  accepting  more  and 
more risk in order to stay on schedule.

NASA  Headquartersʼ  focus  was  on  the  Node  2 
launch date, February 19, 2004. 
The intertwined nature of the Space Shuttle and 
Space  Station  programs  significantly  increased 
the complexity of the schedule and made meeting 
the schedule far more challenging. 
The  capabilities  of  the  system  were  being 
stretched  to  the  limit  to  support  the  schedule. 
Projections  into  2003  showed  stress  on  vehicle 
processing at the Kennedy Space Center, on flight 
controller training at Johnson Space Center, and 
on Space Station crew rotation schedules. Effects 
of this stress included neglecting flight control-
ler  recertification  requirements,  extending  crew 
rotation  schedules,  and  adding  incremental  risk 
by  scheduling  additional  Orbiter  movements  at 
Kennedy.
The  four  flights  scheduled  in  the  five  months 
from  October  2003,  to  February  2004,  would 
have required a processing effort comparable to 
the effort immediately before the Challenger ac-
cident. 
There was no schedule margin to accommodate 
unforeseen problems. When flights come in rapid 
succession, there is no assurance that anomalies 
on one flight will be identified and appropriately 
addressed before the next flight.
The environment of the countdown to Node 2 and 
the importance of maintaining the schedule may 
have  begun  to  influence  managersʼ  decisions, 
including  those  made  about  the  STS-112  foam 
strike. 
During  STS-107,  Shuttle  Program  managers 
were  concerned  with  the  foam  strikeʼs  possible 
effect on the launch schedule.

Recommendation:

R6.2-1 

Adopt and maintain a Shuttle flight schedule that 
is consistent with available resources. Although 
schedule deadlines are an important management 
tool, those deadlines must be regularly evaluated 
to ensure that any additional risk incurred to meet 
the schedule is recognized, understood, and ac-
ceptable.

6.3  DECISION-MAKING DURING THE FLIGHT OF STS-107

Initial Foam Strike Identification 

As soon as Columbia reached orbit on the morning of January 16, 2003, NASAʼs Intercenter 
Photo Working Group began reviewing liftoff imagery by video and film cameras on the launch 
pad and at other sites at and nearby the Kennedy Space Center. The debris strike was not seen 
during the first review of video imagery by tracking cameras, but it was noticed at 9:30 a.m. 
EST the next day, Flight Day Two, by Intercenter Photo Working Group engineers at Marshall 
Space Flight Center. Within an hour, Intercenter Photo Working Group personnel at Kennedy 
also identified the strike on higher-resolution film images that had just been developed.

The images revealed that a large piece of debris from the left bipod area of the External Tank 
had struck the Orbiterʼs left wing. Because the resulting shower of post-impact fragments could 
not be seen passing over the top of the wing, analysts concluded that the debris had apparently 
impacted the left wing below the leading edge. Intercenter Photo Working Group members 
were concerned about the size of the object and the apparent momentum of the strike. In search-
ing for better views, Intercenter Photo Working Group members realized that none of the other 
cameras provided a higher-quality view of the impact and the potential damage to the Orbiter. 

Of the dozen ground-based camera sites used to obtain images of the ascent for engineering 
analyses, each of which has film and video cameras, five are designed to track the Shuttle from 
liftoff until it is out of view. Due to expected angle of view and atmospheric limitations, two 
sites did not capture the debris event. Of the remaining three sites positioned to “see” at least a 
portion of the event, none provided a clear view of the actual debris impact to the wing. The first 
site lost track of Columbia on ascent, the second site was out of focus – because of an improp-
erly maintained lens – and the third site captured only a view of the upper side of Columbiaʼs 
left wing. The Board notes that camera problems also hindered the Challenger investigation. 
Over the years, it appears that due to budget and camera-team staff cuts, NASAʼs ability to track 
ascending Shuttles has atrophied – a development that reflects NASAʼs disregard of the devel-
opmental nature of the Shuttleʼs technology. (See recommendation R3.4-1.)

Because they had no sufficiently resolved pictures with which to determine potential damage, 
and having never seen such a large piece of debris strike the Orbiter so late in ascent, Intercenter 
Photo Working Group members decided to ask for ground-based imagery of Columbia.
IMAGERY REQUEST 1

To accomplish this, the Intercenter Photo Working Groupʼs Chair, Bob Page, contacted Wayne 
Hale, the Shuttle Program Manager for Launch Integration at Kennedy Space Center, to request 
imagery of Columbiaʼs left wing on-orbit. Hale, who agreed to explore the possibility, holds a 
Top Secret clearance and was familiar with the process for requesting military imaging from his 
experience as a Mission Control Flight Director. 

This would be the first of three discrete requests for imagery by a NASA engineer or manager. 
In addition to these three requests, there were, by the Boardʼs count, at least eight “missed op-
portunities” where actions may have resulted in the discovery of debris damage. 

Shortly after confirming the debris hit, Intercenter Photo Working Group members distributed 
a “L+1” (Launch plus one day) report and digitized clips of the strike via e-mail throughout the 
NASA and contractor communities. This report provided an initial view of the foam strike and 
served as the basis for subsequent decisions and actions.

Mission Managementʼs Response to the Foam Strike

As  soon  as  the  Intercenter  Working  Group  report  was  distributed,  engineers  and  technical 
managers from NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing began responding. Engineers and 
managers  from  Kennedy  Space  Center  called  engineers  and  Program  managers  at  Johnson 
Space Center. United Space Alliance and Boeing employees exchanged e-mails with details of 
the initial film analysis and the work in progress to determine the result of the impact. Details 
of the strike, actions taken in response to the impact, and records of telephone conversations 
were documented in the Mission Control operational log. The following section recounts in

chronological order many of these exchanges and provides insight into why, in spite of the 
debris strikeʼs severity, NASA managers ultimately declined to request images of Columbiaʼs 
left wing on-orbit.

Flight Day Two, Friday, January 17, 2003

In the Mission Evaluation Room, a support function of the Shuttle Program office that supplies 
engineering expertise for missions in progress, a set of consoles are staffed by engineers and 
technical managers from NASA and contractor organizations. For record keeping, each Mission 
Evaluation Room member types mission-related comments into a running log. A log entry by a 
Mission Evaluation Room manager at 10:58 a.m. Central Standard Time noted that the vehicle 
may have sustained damage from a debris strike. 

“John Disler [a photo lab engineer at Johnson Space Center] called to report a debris hit 
on the vehicle. The debris appears to originate from the ET Forward Bipod area…travels 
down the left side and hits the left wing leading edge near the fuselage…The launch video 
review team at KSC think that the vehicle may have been damaged by the impact. Bill 
Reeves and Mike Stoner (USA SAM) were notified.” [ET=External Tank, KSC=Kennedy Space 
Center, USA SAM=United Space Alliance Sub-system Area Manager]

At 3:15 p.m., Bob Page, Chair of the Intercenter Photo Working Group, contacted Wayne Hale, 
the Shuttle Program Manager for Launch Integration at Kennedy Space Center, and Lambert 
Austin, the head of the Space Shuttle Systems Integration at Johnson Space Center, to inform 
them that Boeing was performing an analysis to determine trajectories, velocities, angles, and 
energies for the debris impact. Page also stated that photo-analysis would continue over the 
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend as additional film from tracking cameras was devel-
oped. Shortly thereafter, Wayne Hale telephoned Linda Ham, Chair of the Mission Manage-
ment Team, and Ron Dittemore, Space Shuttle Program Manager, to pass along information 
about the debris strike and let them know that a formal report would be issued by the end of 
the day. John Disler, a member of the Intercenter Photo Working Group, notified the Mission 
Evaluation Room manager that a newly formed group of analysts, to be known as the Debris 
Assessment Team, needed the entire weekend to conduct a more thorough analysis. Meanwhile, 
early opinions about Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) resiliency were circulated via e-mail 
between  United  Space Alliance  technical  managers  and  NASA  engineers,  which  may  have 
contributed to a mindset that foam hitting the RCC was not a concern.

RE: STS 107 Debris 

Just spoke with Calvin and Mike Gordon (RCC SSM) about the impact. 

Basically the RCC is extremely resilient to impact type damage. The piece of debris (most likely 
foam/ice) looked like it most likely impacted the WLE RCC and broke apart. It didn’t look like a big 
enough piece to pose any serious threat to the system and Mike Gordon the RCC SSM concurs. At T 
+81seconds the piece wouldn’t have had enough energy to create a large damage to the RCC WLE 
system. Plus they have analysis that says they have a single mission safe re-entry in case of impact 
that penetrates the system. 

As far as the tile go in the wing leading edge area they are thicker than required (taper in the outer 
mold line) and can handle a large area of shallow damage which is what this event most likely would 
have caused. They have impact data that says the structure would get slightly hotter but still be OK.

ENGINEERING COORDINATION AT NASA
AND UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE
After United Space Alliance became contractually responsible for most aspects of Shuttle operations, 
NASA developed procedures to ensure that its own engineering expertise was coordinated with that 
of contractors for any “out-of-family” issue. In the case of the foam strike on STS-107, which was 
classified as out-of-family, clearly defined written guidance led United Space Alliance technical man-
agers to liaise with their NASA counterparts. Once NASA managers were officially notified of the 
foam strike classification, and NASA engineers joined their contractor peers in an early analysis, the 
resultant group should, according to standing procedures, become a Mission Evaluation Room Tiger 
Team. Tiger Teams have clearly defined roles and responsibilities.43 Instead, the group of analysts 
came to be called a Debris Assessment Team. While they were the right group of engineers work-
ing the problem at the right time, by not being classified as a Tiger Team, they did not fall under the 
Shuttle Program procedures described in Tiger Team checklists, and as a result were not “owned” or 
led by Shuttle Program managers. This left the Debris Assessment Team in a kind of organizational 
limbo, with no guidance except the date by which Program managers expected to hear their results: 
January 24th.

Already, by Friday afternoon, Shuttle Program managers and working engineers had different 
levels of concern about what the foam strike might have meant. After reviewing available film, 
Intercenter Photo Working Group engineers believed the Orbiter may have been damaged by 
the strike. They wanted on-orbit images of Columbiaʼs left wing to confirm their suspicions 
and initiated action to obtain them. Boeing and United Space Alliance engineers decided to 
work through the holiday weekend to analyze the strike. At the same time, high-level managers 
Ralph Roe, head of the Shuttle Program Office of Vehicle Engineering, and Bill Reeves, from 
United Space Alliance, voiced a lower level of concern. It was at this point, before any analysis 
had started, that Shuttle Program managers officially shared their belief that the strike posed no 
safety issues, and that there was no need for a review to be conducted over the weekend. The 
following is a 4:28 p.m. Mission Evaluation Room manager log entry: 

“Bill Reeves called, after a meeting with Ralph Roe, it is confirmed that USA/Boeing will 
not work the debris issue over the weekend, but will wait till Monday when the films are 
released. The LCC constraints on ice, the energy/speed of impact at +81 seconds, and the 
toughness of the RCC are two main factors for the low concern. Also, analysis supports 
single mission safe re-entry for an impact that penetrates the system…” [USA=United Space 
Alliance, LCC=Launch Commit Criteria]

The following is a 4:37 p.m. Mission Evaluation Room manager log entry. 

“Bob Page told MER that KSC/TPS engineers were sent by the USA SAM/Woody Wood-
worth to review the video and films. Indicated that Page had said that Woody had said this 
was an action from the MER to work this issue and a possible early landing on Tuesday. 
MER Manager told Bob that no official action was given by USA or Boeing and they had 
no concern about landing early. Woody indicated that the TPS engineers at KSC have been 
ʻturned awayʼ from reviewing the films. It was stated that the film reviews wouldnʼt be fin-
ished till Monday.” [MER=Mission Evaluation Room, KSC=Kennedy Space Center, TPS=Thermal 
Protection System, USA SAM=United Space Alliance Sub-system Area Manager]

The Mission Evaluation Room manager also wrote: 

“I also confirmed that there was no rush on this issue and that it was okay to wait till the 
film reviews are finished on Monday to do a TPS review.”

In addition to individual log entries by Mission Evaluation Room members, managers prepared 
“handover” notes for delivery from one working shift to the next. Handovers from Shift 1 to 2 
on January 17 included the following entry under a “problem” category.

“Disler Report – Debris impact on port wing edge-appears to have originated at the ET 
fwd bipod – foam?- if so, it shouldnʼt be a problem – video clip will be available on the web 
soon – will look at high-speed film today.” [ET=External Tank, fwd=forward]

Shortly after these entries were made, the deputy manager of Johnson Space Center Shuttle En-
gineering notified Rodney Rocha, NASAʼs designated chief engineer for the Thermal Protection 
System, of the strike and the approximate debris size. It was Rochaʼs responsibility to coordinate 
NASA engineering resources and work with contract engineers at United Space Alliance, who 
together would form a Debris Assessment Team that would be Co-Chaired by United Space Al-
liance engineering manager Pam Madera. The United Space Alliance deputy manager of Shuttle 
Engineering signaled that the debris strike was initially classified as “out-of-family” and there-
fore of greater concern than previous debris strikes. At about the same time, the Intercenter Photo 
Working Groupʼs L+1 report, containing both video clips and still images of the debris strike, 
was e-mailed to engineers and technical managers both inside and outside of NASA. 

Flight Days Three and Four, Saturday and Sunday, January 18 and 19, 2003

Though senior United Space Alliance Manager Bill Reeves had told Mission Evaluation Room 
personnel that the debris problem would not be worked over the holiday weekend, engineers 
from Boeing did in fact work through the weekend. Boeing analysts conducted a preliminary 
damage assessment on Saturday. Using video and photo images, they generated two estimates 
of possible debris size – 20 inches by 20 inches by 2 inches, and 20 inches by 16 inches by 6 
inches – and determined that the debris was traveling at a approximately 750 feet per second, 
or 511 miles per hour, when it struck the Orbiter at an estimated impact angle of less than 20 
degrees. These estimates later proved remarkably accurate.

To calculate the damage that might result from such a strike, the analysts turned to a Boeing 
mathematical modeling tool called Crater that uses a specially developed algorithm to predict 
the depth of a Thermal Protection System tile to which debris will penetrate. This algorithm, suit-
able for estimating small (on the order of three cubic inches) debris impacts, had been calibrated 
by the results of foam, ice, and metal debris impact testing. A similar Crater-like algorithm was 
also developed and validated with test results to assess the damage caused by ice projectiles 
impacting the RCC leading edge panels. These tests showed that within certain limits, the Crater 
algorithm predicted more severe damage than was observed. This led engineers to classify Crater 
as a “conservative” tool – one that predicts more damage than will actually occur.

Until STS-107, Crater was normally used only to predict whether small debris, usually ice on 
the External Tank, would pose a threat to the Orbiter during launch. The use of Crater to assess 
the damage caused by foam during the launch of STS-107 was the first use of the model while 
a mission was on orbit. Also of note is that engineers used Crater during STS-107 to analyze a 
piece of debris that was at maximum 640 times larger in volume than the pieces of debris used 
to calibrate and validate the Crater model (the Boardʼs best estimate is that it actually was 400 
times larger). Therefore, the use of Crater in this new and very different situation compromised 
NASAʼs ability to accurately predict debris damage in ways that Debris Assessment Team en-
gineers did not fully comprehend (see Figure 6.3-1).

In 1966, during the Apollo program, engineers developed an equation to assess impact damage, or “cra-
tering,” by micrometeoroids.44 The equation was modified between 1979 and 1985 to enable the analy-
sis of impacts to “acreage” tiles that cover the lower surface of the Orbiter.45 The modified equation, 
now known as Crater, predicts possible damage from sources such as foam, ice, and launch site debris, 
and is most often used in the day-of-launch analysis of ice debris falling off the External Tank.46

When used within its validated limits, Crater provides conservative predictions (that is, Crater pre-
dictions are larger than actual damage). When used outside its validated limits, Craterʼs precision is 
unknown.

Crater has been correlated to actual impact data using results from several tests. Preliminary ice drop 
tests were performed in 1978,47 and additional tests using sprayed-on foam insulation projectiles 
were conducted in 1979 and 1999.48 However, the test projectiles were relatively small (maximum 
volume of 3 cubic inches), and targeted only single tiles, not groups of tiles as actually installed on 
the Orbiter. No tests were performed with larger debris objects because it was not believed such 
debris could ever impact the Orbiter. This resulted in a very limited set of conditions under which 
Craterʼs results were empirically validated.

During 1984, tests were conducted using ice projectiles against the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon used 
on the Orbitersʼ wing leading edges.49 These tests used an 0.875-inch diameter, 3.75-inch long ice 
projectile to validate an algorithm that was similar to Crater. Unlike Crater, which was designed to 
predict damage during a flight, the RCC predictions were intended to determine the thickness of RCC 
required to withstand ice impacts as an aid to design engineers. Like Crater, however, the limited set 
of test data significantly restricts the potential application of the model.

Other  damage  assessment  methods  available  today,  such  as  hydrodynamic  structural  codes,  like 
Dyna, are able to analyze a larger set of projectile sizes and materials than Crater. Boeing and NASA 
did not currently sanction these finite element codes because of the time required to correlate their 
results in order to use the models effectively.

Although Crater was designed, and certified, for a very limited set of impact events, the results from 
Crater simulations can be generated quickly. During STS-107, this led to Crater being used to model 
an event that was well outside the parameters against which it had been empirically validated. As the 
accompanying table shows, many of the STS-107 debris characteristics were orders of magnitude 
outside the validated envelope. For instance, while Crater had been designed and validated for pro-
jectiles up to 3 cubic inches in volume, the initial STS-107 analysis estimated the piece of debris at 
1,200 cubic inches – 400 times larger.

Over the weekend, an engineer certified by Boeing to use Crater entered the two estimated 
debris dimensions, the estimated debris velocity, and the estimated angle of impact. The en-
gineer had received formal training on Crater from senior Houston-based Boeing engineering 
staff, but he had only used the program twice before, and had reservations about using it to 
model the piece of foam debris that struck Columbia. The engineer did not consult with more 
experienced engineers from Boeingʼs Huntington Beach, California, facility, who up until the 
time of STS-107 had performed or overseen Crater analysis. (Boeing completed the transfer of 
responsibilities for Crater analysis from its Huntington Beach engineers to its Houston office 
in January 2003. STS-107 was the first mission that the Huntington Beach engineers were not 
directly involved with.)

For the Thermal Protection System tile, Crater predicted damage deeper than the actual tile 
thickness.  This  seemingly  alarming  result  suggested  that  the  debris  that  struck  Columbia 
would have exposed the Orbiterʼs underlying aluminum airframe to extreme temperatures, 
resulting in a possible burn-through during re-entry. Debris Assessment Team engineers dis-
counted the possibility of burn through for two reasons. First, the results of calibration tests 
with small projectiles showed that Crater predicted a deeper penetration than would actually 
occur. Second, the Crater equation does not take into account the increased density of a tileʼs 
lower “densified” layer, which is much stronger than tileʼs fragile outer layer. Therefore, engi-
neers judged that the actual damage from the large piece of foam lost on STS-107 would not 
be as severe as Crater predicted, and assumed that the debris did not penetrate the Orbiterʼs 
skin. This uncertainty, however, meant that determining the precise location of the impact was 
paramount for an accurate damage estimate. Some areas on the Orbiterʼs lower surface, such 
as the seals around the landing gear doors, are more vulnerable than others. Only by knowing 
precisely where the debris struck could the analysts more accurately determine if the Orbiter 
had been damaged.

To determine potential RCC damage, analysts used a Crater-like algorithm that was calibrated 
in 1984 by impact data from ice projectiles. At the time the algorithm was empirically tested, 
ice was considered the only realistic threat to RCC integrity. (See Appendix E.4, RCC Impact 
Analysis.) The Debris Assessment Team analysis indicated that impact angles greater than 15 
degrees would result in RCC penetration. A separate “transport” analysis, which attempts to 
determine the path the debris took, identified 15 strike regions and angles of impact. Twelve 
transport scenarios predicted an impact in regions of Shuttle tile. Only one scenario predicted 
an impact on the RCC leading edge, at a 21-degree angle. Because the foam that struck Colum-
bia was less dense than ice, Debris Assessment Team analysts used a qualitative extrapolation 
of the test data and engineering judgment to conclude that a foam impact angle up to 21 degrees 
would not penetrate the RCC. Although some engineers were uncomfortable with this extrapo-
lation, no other analyses were performed to assess RCC damage. The Debris Assessment Team 
focused on analyzing the impact at locations other than the RCC leading edge. This may have 
been due, at least in part, to the transport analysis presentation and the long-standing belief 
that foam was not a threat to RCC panels. The assumptions and uncertainty embedded in this 
analysis were never fully presented to the Mission Evaluation Room or the Mission Manage-
ment Team.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY 1

On Sunday, Rodney Rocha e-mailed a Johnson Space Center Engineering Directorate manager 
to ask if a Mission Action Request was in progress for Columbiaʼs crew to visually inspect the 
left wing for damage. Rocha never received an answer.

RCC Panel 12

This photo from the aft flight deck window of an Orbiter shows that RCC panels 1 – 11 are not visible 
from inside the Orbiter. Since Columbia did not have a manipulator arm for STS-107, it would have been 
necessary for an astronaut to take a spacewalk to visibly inspect the inboard leading edge of the wing.

Flight Day Five, Monday, January 20, 2003

On Monday morning, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the Debris Assessment Team held an 
informal meeting before its first formal meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. 
The team expanded to include NASA and Boeing transport analysts expert in the movement 
of debris in airflows, tile and RCC experts from Boeing and NASA, aerothermal and thermal 
engineers from NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing, and a safety representative from the 
NASA contractor Science Applications International Corporation. 

Engineers emerged from that informal meeting with a goal of obtaining images from ground-
based assets. Uncertainty as to precisely where the debris had struck Columbia generated con-
cerns about the possibility of a breach in the left main landing gear door seal. They conducted 
further analysis using angle and thickness variables and thermal data obtained by personnel at 
Boeingʼs Huntington Beach facility for STS-87 and STS-50, the two missions that had incurred 
Thermal Protection System damage. (See Section 6.1.)

Debris Assessment Team Co-Chair Pam Madera distributed an e-mail summarizing the dayʼs 
events and outlined the agenda for Tuesdayʼs first formal Debris Assessment Team meeting. 
Included on the agenda was the desire to obtain on-orbit images of Columbiaʼs left wing. 

According to an 11:39 a.m. entry in the Mission Evaluation Room Managerʼs log: 

“…the debris ʻblobʼ is estimated at 20” +/-10” in some direction, using the Orbiter hatch 
as a basis. It appears to be similar size as that seen in STS-112. There will be more com-
parison work done, and more info and details in tomorrowʼs report.”

This entry illustrates, in NASA language, an initial attempt by managers to classify this bipod 
ramp foam strike as close to being within the experience base and therefore, being almost an 
“in-family” event, not necessarily a safety concern. While the size and source of STS-107 de-
bris was somewhat similar to what STS-112 had experienced, the impact sites (the wing versus 
the Solid Rocket Booster) differed – a distinction not examined by mission managers.

Flight Day Six, Tuesday, January 21, 2003

At 7:00 a.m., the Debris Assessment Team briefed Don McCormack, the chief Mission Evalu-
ation Room manager, that the foamʼs source and size was similar to what struck STS-112, and 
that an analysis of measured versus predicted tile damage from STS-87 was being scrutinized 
by Boeing. An hour later, McCormack related this information to the Mission Management 
Team at its first post-holiday meeting. Although Space Shuttle Program requirements state that 
the Mission Management Team will convene daily during a mission, the STS-107 Mission 
Management Team met only on January 17, 21, 24, 27, and 31. The transcript below is the first 
record of an official discussion of the debris impact at a Mission Management Team meeting. 
Before even referring to the debris strike, the Mission Management Team focused on end-of-
mission “downweight” (the Orbiter was 150 pounds over the limit), a leaking water separator, 
a jammed Hasselblad camera, payload and experiment status, and a communications downlink 
problem. McCormack then stated that engineers planned to determine what could be done if 
Columbia had sustained damage. STS-107 Mission Management Team Chair Linda Ham sug-
gested the team learn what rationale had been used to fly after External Tank foam losses on 
STS-87 and STS-112.

Transcript Excerpts from the January 21, Mission Management Team Meeting 

Ham: “Alright, I know you guys are looking at the debris.”

McCormack: “Yeah, as everybody knows, we took a hit on the, somewhere on the left wing 
leading edge and the photo TV guys have completed I think, pretty much their work although 
Iʼm sure they are reviewing their stuff and theyʼve given us an approximate size for the debris 
and approximate area for where it came from and approximately where it hit, so we are talking 
about doing some sort of parametric type of analysis and also weʼre talking about what you can 
do in the event we have some damage there.”

Ham: “That comment, I was thinking that the flight rationale at the FRR from tank and orbiter 
from STS-112 was.… Iʼm not sure that the area is exactly the same where the foam came from 
but the carrier properties and density of the foam wouldnʼt do any damage. So we ought to pull 
that along with the 87 data where we had some damage, pull this data from 112 or whatever 
flight it was and make sure that…you know I hope that we had good flight rationale then.”

McCormack: “Yeah, and weʼll look at that, you mentioned 87, you know we saw some fairly 
significant damage in the area between RCC panels 8 and 9 and the main landing gear door on 
the bottom on STS-87 we did some analysis prior to STS-89 so uh…”

Ham: “And Iʼm really I donʼt think there is much we can do so itʼs not really a factor during the 
flight because there is not much we can do about it. But what Iʼm really interested in is making 
sure our flight rationale to go was good, and maybe this is foam from a different area and Iʼm 
not sure and it may not be co-related, but you can try to see what we have.”

McCormack: “Okay.”

After the meeting, the rationale for continuing to fly after the STS-112 foam loss was sent to 
Ham for review. She then exchanged e-mails with her boss, Space Shuttle Program Manager 
Ron Dittemore:

You probably can’t open the attachment. But, the ET rationale for flight for the STS-112 loss of foam 
was lousy. Rationale states we haven’t changed anything, we haven’t experienced any ‘safety of flight’ 
damage in 112 flights, risk of loss of bi-pod ramp TPS is same as previous flghts...So ET is safe to fly 
with no added risk

Rationale was lousy then and still is....

Hamʼs focus on examining the rationale for continuing to fly after the foam problems with 
STS-87 and STS-112 indicates that her attention had already shifted from the threat the foam 
posed to STS-107 to the downstream implications of the foam strike. Ham was due to serve, 
along with Wayne Hale, as the launch integration manager for the next mission, STS-114. If the 
Shuttle Programʼs rationale to fly with foam loss was found to be flawed, STS-114, due to be 
launched in about a month, would have to be delayed per NASA rules that require serious prob-
lems to be resolved before the next flight. An STS-114 delay could in turn delay completion of 
the International Space Stationʼs Node 2, which was a high-priority goal for NASA managers. 
(See Section 6.2 for a detailed description of schedule pressures.)

During this same Mission Management Team meeting, the Space Shuttle Integration Officeʼs 
Lambert Austin reported that engineers were reviewing long-range tracking film and that the 
foam debris that appeared to hit the left wing leading edge may have come from the bipod area 
of the External Tank. Austin said that the Engineering Directorate would continue to run analy-
ses and compare this foam loss to that of STS-112. Austin also said that after STS-107 landed, 
engineers were anxious to see the crew-filmed footage of External Tank separation that might 
show the bipod ramp and therefore could be checked for missing foam. 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY 2

Reviews of flight-deck footage confirm that on Flight Day One, Mission Specialist David Brown 
filmed parts of the External Tank separation with a Sony PD-100 Camcorder, and Payload Com-
mander Mike Anderson photographed it with a Nikon F-5 camera with a 400-millimeter lens. 
Brown later downlinked 35 seconds of this video to the ground as part of his Flight Day One mis-
sion summary, but the bipod ramp area had rotated out of view, so no evidence of missing foam 
was seen when this footage was reviewed during the mission. However, after the Intercenter 
Photo Working Group caught the debris strike on January 17, ground personnel failed to ask 
Brown if he had additional footage of External Tank separation. Based on how crews are trained 
to film External Tank separation, the Board concludes Brown did in fact have more film than the 
35 seconds he downlinked. Such footage may have confirmed that foam was missing from the 
bipod ramp area or could have identified other areas of missing foam. Austinʼs mention of the 
crewʼs filming of External Tank separation should have prompted someone at the meeting to ask 
Brown if he had more External Tank separation film, and if so, to downlink it immediately.

Flight Director Steve Stich discussed the debris strike with Phil Engelauf, a member of the 
Mission Operations Directorate, after Engelauf returned from the Mission Management Team 
meeting. As written in a timeline Stich composed after the accident, the conversation included 
the following.

“Phil said the Space Shuttle Program community is not concerned and that Orbiter Project 
is analyzing ascent debris…relayed that there had been no direction for MOD to ask DOD 
for any photography of possible damaged tiles” [MOD=Mission Operations Directorate, or 
Mission Control, DOD=Department of Defense]

“No direction for DOD photography” seems to refer to either a previous discussion of pho-
tography with Mission managers or an expectation of future activity. Since the interagency 
agreement on imaging support stated that the Flight Dynamics Officer is responsible for initiat-
ing such a request, Engelaufʼs comments demonstrates that an informal chain of command, in 
which the Mission Operations Directorate figures prominently, was at work.

About an hour later, Calvin Schomburg, a Johnson Space Center engineer with close connections 
to Shuttle management, sent the following e-mail to other Johnson engineering managers.

Shuttle Program managers regarded Schomburg as an expert on the Thermal Protection System. 
His message downplays the possibility that foam damaged the Thermal Protection System. 
However, the Board notes that Schomburg was not an expert on Reinforced Carbon-Carbon 
(RCC),  which  initial  debris  analysis  indicated  the  foam  may  have  struck.  Because  neither 
Schomburg nor Shuttle management rigorously differentiated between tiles and RCC panels, 
the bounds of Schomburgʼs expertise were never properly qualified or questioned.

Seven minutes later, Paul Shack, Manager of the Shuttle Engineering Office, Johnson Engineer-
ing Directorate, e-mailed to Rocha and other Johnson engineering managers information on 
how previous bipod ramp foam losses were handled.

RE: STS-107 Debris Analysis Team Plans

This reminded me that at the STS-113 FRR the ET Project reported on foam loss from the Bipod 
Ramp during STS-112. The foam (estimated 4X5X12 inches) impacted the ET Attach Ring and 
dented an SRB electronics box cover.

Their charts stated “ET TPS foam loss over the life of the Shuttle program has never been a ‘Safety of 
Flight’ issue”. They were severely wire brushed over this and Brian O’Conner (Associate Administra-

tor for Safety) asked for a hazard assessment for loss of foam. 

[continued on next page]

The suspected cause for foam loss is trapped air pockets which expand due to altitude and aerother-
mal heating.

[FRR=Flight Readiness Review, ET=External Tank, SRB=Solid Rocket Booster, TPS=Thermal Protection System]

Shackʼs message informed Rocha that during the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review, foam loss 
was not considered to be a safety-of-flight issue. The “wirebrushing” that the External Tank 
Project received for stating that foam loss has “never been a ʻSafety of Flightʼ issue” refers to 
the wording used to justify continuing to fly. Officials at the Flight Readiness Review insisted 
on classifying the foam loss as an “accepted risk” rather than “not a safety-of-flight problem” 
to indicate that although the Shuttle would continue to fly, the threat posed by foam is not zero 
but rather a known and acceptable risk.

It is here that the decision to fly before resolving the foam problem at the STS-113 Flight 
Readiness Review influences decisions made during STS-107. Having at hand a previously 
accepted rationale – reached just one mission ago – that foam strikes are not a safety-of-flight 
issue provides a strong incentive for Mission managers and working engineers to use that 
same judgment for STS-107. If managers and engineers were to argue that foam strikes are 
a safety-of-flight issue, they would contradict an established consensus that was a product of 
the Shuttle Programʼs most rigorous review – a review in which many of them were active 
participants.

An entry in a Mission Evaluation Room console log included a 10:30 a.m. report that compared 
the STS-107 foam loss to previous foam losses and subsequent tile damage, which reinforced 
management acceptance about foam strikes by indicating that the foam strike appeared to be 
more of an “in-family” event.

“…STS-107 debris measured at 22” long +/- 10”. On STS-112 the debris spray pattern 
was a lot smaller than that of STS-107. On STS-50 debris that was determined to be the 
Bipod ramp which measured 26” x 10” caused damage to the left wing…to 1 tile and 20% 
of the adjacent tile. Same event occurred on STS-7 (no data available).” 

MISSED OPPORTUNITY 3

The foam strike to STS-107 was mentioned by a speaker at an unrelated meeting of NASA 
Headquarters  and  National  Imagery  and  Mapping Agency  personnel,  who  then  discussed  a 
possible NASA request for Department of Defense imagery support. However, no action was 
taken.
IMAGERY REQUEST 2

Responding to concerns from his employees who were participating in the Debris Assessment 
Team, United Space Alliance manager Bob White called Lambert Austin on Flight Day Six 
to ask what it would take to get imagery of Columbia on orbit. They discussed the analytical 
debris damage work plan, as well as the belief of some integration team members that such 
imaging might be beneficial.

Austin subsequently telephoned the Department of Defense Manned Space Flight Support Of-
fice representative to ask about actions necessary to get imagery of Columbia on orbit. Austin 
emphasized that this was merely information gathering, not a request for action. This call indi-
cates that Austin was unfamiliar with NASA/National Imagery and Mapping Agency imagery 
request procedures.

An e-mail that Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Lee sent to Don McCormack the following day 
shows that the Defense Department had begun to implement Austinʼs request.

NASA request for DOD

Don,

FYI: Lambert Austin called me yesterday requesting DOD photo support for STS-107. Specifically, he 
is asking us if we have a ground or satellite asset that can take a high resolution photo of the shuttle 
while on-orbit--to see if there is any FOD damage on the wing. We are working his request.

Tim

[DOD=Department of Defense, FOD=Foreign Object Debris]

At the same time, managers Ralph Roe, Lambert Austin, and Linda Ham referred to conversa-
tions with Calvin Schomburg, whom they referred to as a Thermal Protection System “expert.” 
They indicated that Schomburg had advised that any tile damage should be considered a turn-
around maintenance concern and not a safety-of-flight issue, and that imagery of Columbiaʼs 
left wing was not necessary. There was no discussion of potential RCC damage.

First Debris Assessment Team Meeting

On Flight Day Six, the Debris Assessment Team held its first formal meeting to finalize Orbiter 
damage estimates and their potential consequences. Some participants joined the proceedings 
via conference call. 
IMAGERY REQUEST 3

After two hours of discussing the Crater results and the need to learn precisely where the debris 
had hit Columbia, the Debris Assessment Team assigned its NASA Co-Chair, Rodney Rocha, 
to pursue a request for imagery of the vehicle on-orbit. Each team member supported the idea 
to seek imagery from an outside source. Rather than working the request up the usual mission 
chain of command through the Mission Evaluation Room to the Mission Management Team to 
the Flight Dynamics Officer, the Debris Assessment Team agreed, largely due to a lack of par-
ticipation by Mission Management Team and Mission Evaluation Room managers, that Rocha 
would pursue the request through his division, the Engineering Directorate at Johnson Space 
Center. Rocha sent the following e-mail to Paul Shack shortly after the meeting adjourned.

The meeting participants (Boeing, USA, NASA ES2 and ES3, KSC) all agreed we will always have 
big uncertainties in any transport/trajectory analyses and applicability/extrapolation of the old Arc-Jet 
test data until we get definitive, better, clearer photos of the wing and body underside. Without better 
images it will be very difficult to even bound the problem and initialize thermal, trajectory, and struc-
tural analyses. Their answers may have a wide spread ranging from acceptable to not-acceptable to 
horrible, and no way to reduce uncertainty. Thus, giving MOD options for entry will be very difficult.

Can we petition (beg) for outside agency assistance? We are asking for Frank Benz with Ralph Roe 
or Ron Dittemore to ask for such. Some of the old timers here remember we got such help in the early 
1980’s when we had missing tile concerns.

Despite some nay-sayers, there are some options for the team to talk about: On-orbit thermal condi-
tioning for the major structure (but is in contradiction with tire pressure temp. cold limits), limiting high 
cross-range de-orbit entries, constraining right or left had turns during the Heading Alignment Circle 
(only if there is struc. damage to the RCC panels to the extent it affects flight control.

Routing the request through the Engineering department led in part to it being viewed by Shuttle 
Program managers as a non-critical engineering desire rather than a critical operational need.

Flight Day Seven, Wednesday, January 22, 2003

Conversations and log entries on Flight Day Seven document how three requests for images 
(Bob Page to Wayne Hale, Bob White to Lambert Austin, and Rodney Rocha to Paul Shack) 
were ultimately dismissed by the Mission Management Team, and how the order to halt those 
requests was then interpreted by the Debris Assessment Team as a direct and final denial of their 
request for imagery.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY 4

On the morning of Flight Day Seven, Wayne Hale responded to the earlier Flight Day Two re-
quest from Bob Page and a call from Lambert Austin on Flight Day Five, during which Austin 
mentioned that “some analysts” from the Debris Assessment Team were interested in getting 
imagery. Hale called a Department of Defense representative at Kennedy Space Center (who 
was not the designated Department of Defense official for coordinating imagery requests) and 
asked that the military start the planning process for imaging Columbia on orbit.

Within  an  hour,  the  Defense  Department  representative  at  NASA  contacted  U.S.  Strategic 
Command (USSTRATCOM) at Coloradoʼs Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station and asked 
what it would take to get imagery of Columbia on orbit. (This call was similar to Austinʼs call 
to the Department of Defense Manned Space Flight Support Office in that the caller character-
ized it as “information gathering” rather than a request for action.) A representative from the 
USSTRATCOM Plans Office initiated actions to identify ground-based and other imaging as-
sets that could execute the request.

Haleʼs  earlier  call  to  the  Defense  Department  representative  at  Kennedy  Space  Center  was 
placed without authorization from Mission Management Team Chair Linda Ham. Also, the call 
was made to a Department of Defense Representative who was not the designated liaison for 
handling such requests. In order to initiate the imagery request through official channels, Hale 
also called Phil Engelauf at the Mission Operations Directorate, told him he had started Defense 
Department action, and asked if Engelauf could have the Flight Dynamics Officer at Johnson 
Space Center make an official request to the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center. Engelauf 
started to comply with Haleʼs request.

After the Department of Defense representatives were called, Lambert Austin telephoned Linda 
Ham to inform her about the imagery requests that he and Hale had initiated. Austin also told 
Wayne Hale that he had asked Lieutenant Colonel Lee at the Department of Defense Manned 
Space Flight Support Office about what actions were necessary to get on-orbit imagery.
MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 5 AND 6

Mike Card, a NASA Headquarters manager from the Safety and Mission Assurance Office, 
called Mark Erminger at the Johnson Space Center Safety and Mission Assurance for Shuttle 
Safety Program and Bryan OʼConnor, Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assur-
ance, to discuss a potential Department of Defense imaging request. Erminger said that he was 
told this was an “in-family” event. OʼConnor stated he would defer to Shuttle management in 
handling such a request. Despite two safety officials being contacted, one of whom was NASAʼs 
highest-ranking safety official, safety personnel took no actions to obtain imagery.

The following is an 8:09 a.m. entry in the Mission Evaluation Room Console log.

“We received a visit from Mission Manager/Vanessa Ellerbe and FD Office/Phil Engelauf 
regarding two items: (1) the MMTʼs action item to the MER to determine the impacts to the 
vehicleʼs 150 lbs of additional weight…and (2) Mr. Engelauf wants to know who is request-
ing the Air Force to look at the vehicle.” [FD=Flight Director, MMT=Mission Management Team, 
MER=Mission Evaluation Room]

CANCELLATION OF THE REQUEST FOR IMAGERY

At 8:30 a.m., the NASA Department of Defense liaison officer called USSTRATCOM and can-
celled the request for imagery. The reason given for the cancellation was that NASA had identi-
fied its own in-house resources and no longer needed the militaryʼs help. The NASA request to 
the Department of Defense to prepare to image Columbia on-orbit was both made and rescinded 
within 90 minutes.

The Board has determined that the following sequence of events likely occurred within that 90-
minute period. Linda Ham asked Lambert Austin if he knew who was requesting the imagery. 
After admitting his participation in helping to make the imagery request outside the official 
chain of command and without first gaining Hamʼs permission, Austin referred to his conver-
sation with United Space Alliance Shuttle Integration manager Bob White on Flight Day Six, 
in which White had asked Austin, in response to Whiteʼs Debris Assessment Team employee 
concerns, what it would take to get Orbiter imagery. 

Even though Austin had already informed Ham of the request for imagery, Ham later called 
Mission Management Team members Ralph Roe, Manager of the Space Shuttle Vehicle En-
gineering Office, Loren Shriver, United Space Alliance Deputy Program Manager for Shuttle, 
and David Moyer, the on-duty Mission Evaluation Room manager, to determine the origin of 
the request and to confirm that there was a “requirement” for a request. Ham also asked Flight 
Director Phil Engelauf if he had a “requirement” for imagery of Columbiaʼs left wing. These 
individuals all stated that they had not requested imagery, were not aware of any “official” 
requests for imagery, and could not identify a “requirement” for imagery. Linda Ham later told 
several individuals that nobody had a requirement for imagery. 

What started as a request by the Intercenter Photo Working Group to seek outside help in ob-
taining images on Flight Day Two in anticipation of analystsʼ needs had become by Flight Day 
Six an actual engineering request by members of the Debris Assessment Team, made informally 
through Bob White to Lambert Austin, and formally in Rodney Rochaʼs e-mail to Paul Shack. 
These requests had then caused Lambert Austin and Wayne Hale to contact Department of 
Defense  representatives.  When  Ham  officially  terminated  the  actions  that  the  Department 
of Defense had begun, she effectively terminated both the Intercenter Photo Working Group 
request and the Debris Assessment Team request. While Ham has publicly stated she did not 
know of the Debris Assessment Team membersʼ desire for imagery, she never asked them di-
rectly if the request was theirs, even though they were the team analyzing the foam strike. 

Also on Flight Day Seven, Ham raised concerns that the extra time spent maneuvering Columbia 
to make the left wing visible for imaging would unduly impact the mission schedule; for ex-

ample, science experiments would have to stop while the imagery was taken. According to 
personal notes obtained by the Board:

“Linda Ham said it was no longer being pursued since even if we saw something, we 
couldnʼt do anything about it. The Program didnʼt want to spend the resources.”

Shuttle managers, including Ham, also said they were looking for very small areas on the Or-
biter and that past imagery resolution was not very good. The Board notes that no individuals in 
the STS-107 operational chain of command had the security clearance necessary to know about 
National imaging capabilities. Additionally, no evidence has been uncovered that anyone from 
NASA, United Space Alliance, or Boeing sought to determine the expected quality of images 
and the difficulty and costs of obtaining Department of Defense assistance. Therefore, members 
of the Mission Management Team were making critical decisions about imagery capabilities 
based on little or no knowledge.

The following is an entry in the Flight Director Handover Log.

“NASA Resident Office, Peterson AFB called and SOI at USSPACECOM was officially 
turned off. This went all the way up to 4 star General. Post flight we will write a memo to 
USSPACECOM telling them whom they should take SOI requests from.”50 [AFB=Air Force 
Base, SOI=Spacecraft Object Identification, USSPACECOM=U.S. Space Command]

After canceling the Department of Defense imagery request, Linda Ham continued to explore 
whether foam strikes posed a safety of flight issue. She sent an e-mail to Lambert Austin and 
Ralph Roe.

Another thought, we need to make sure that the density of the ET foam cannot damage the tile to 
where it is an impact to the orbiter...Lambert and Ralph need to get some folks working with ET.

RE: ET Foam Loss

No-the amount of damage ET foam can cause to the TPS material-tiles is based on the amount of 
impact energy-the size of the piece and its velocity( from just after pad clear until about 120 seconds-
after that it will not hit or it will not enough energy to cause any damage)-it is a pure kinetic problem-
there is a size that can cause enough damage to a tile that enough of the material is lost that we 
could burn a hole through the skin and have a bad day-(loss of vehicle and crew -about 200-400 tile 
locations( out of the 23,000 on the lower surface)-the foam usually fails in small popcorn pieces-that 
is why it is vented-to make small hits-the two or three times we have been hit with a piece as large 
as the one this flight-we got a gouge about 8-10 inches long about 2 inches wide and 3/4 to an 1 inch 
deep across two or three tiles. That is what I expect this time-nothing worst. If that is all we get we 
have have no problem-will have to replace a couple of tiles but nothing else.

RE: ET Foam Loss

NO. I will cover some of the pertinent rationale....there could be more if I spent more time thinking 
about it. Recall this issue has been discussed from time to time since the inception of the basic “no 
debris” requirement in Vol. X and at each review the SSP has concluded that it is not possible to 
PRECLUDE a potential catastrophic event as a result of debris impact damage to the flight elements. 
As regards the Orbiter, both windows and tiles are areas of concern.

You can talk to Cal Schomberg and he will verify the many times we have covered this in SSP 
reviews. While there is much tolerance to window and tile damage, ET foam loss can result in im-
pact damage that under subsequent entry environments can lead to loss of structural integrity of the 
Orbiter area impacted or a penetration in a critical function area that results in loss of that function. 
My recollection of the most critical Orbiter bottom acreage areas are the wing spar, main landing gear 
door seal and RCC panels...of course Cal can give you a much better rundown.

We can and have generated parametric impact zone characterizations for many areas of the Orbiter 
for a few of our more typical ET foam loss areas. Of course, the impact/damage significance is always 
a function of debris size and density, impact velocity, and impact angle--these latter 2 being a function 
of the flight time at which the ET foam becomes debris. For STS-107 specifically, we have generated

 this info and provided it to Orbiter. Of course, even this is based on the ASSUMPTION that the loca-
tion and size of the debris is the same as occurred on STS-112------this cannot be verified until we 
receive the on-board ET separation photo evidence post Orbiter landing. We are requesting that this 
be expedited. I have the STS-107 Orbiter impact map based on the assumptions noted herein being 
sent down to you. Rod is in a review with Orbiter on this info right now.

The Board notes that these e-mail exchanges indicate that senior Mission Management Team 
managers, including the Shuttle Program Manager, Mission Management Team Chair, head of 
Space Shuttle Systems Integration, and a Shuttle tile expert, correctly identified the technical 
bounds of the foam strike problem and its potential seriousness. Mission managers understood 
that the relevant question was not whether foam posed a safety-of-flight issue – it did – but 
rather whether the observed foam strike contained sufficient kinetic energy to cause damage 
that could lead to a burn-through. Here, all the key managers were asking the right question 
and admitting the danger. They even identified RCC as a critical impact zone. Yet little follow-
through occurred with either the request for imagery or the Debris Assessment Team analysis. 
(See Section 3.4 and 3.6 for details on the kinetics of foam strikes.)

A Mission Evaluation Room log entry at 10:37 a.m. records the decision not to seek imaging 
of Columbiaʼs left wing.

“USA Program Manager/Loren Shriver, NASA Manager, Program Integration/Linda Ham, 
& NASA SSVEO/Ralph Roe have stated that there is no need for the Air Force to take a look 
at the vehicle.” [USA=United Space Alliance, SSVEO=Space Shuttle Vehicle Engineering Office]

At 11:22 a.m., Debris Assessment Team Co-Chair Pam Madera sent an e-mail to team members 
setting the agenda for the teamʼs second formal meeting that afternoon that included:

“… Discussion on Need/Rationale for Mandatory Viewing of damage site (All)…”

Earlier e-mail agenda wording did not include “Need/Rationale for Mandatory” wording as 
listed here, which indicates that Madera knew of managementʼs decision to not seek images of 
Columbiaʼs left wing and anticipated having to articulate a “mandatory” rationale to reverse that 
decision. In fact, a United Space Alliance manager had informed Madera that imagery would be 
sought only if the request was a “mandatory need.” Twenty-three minutes later, an e-mail from 
Paul Shack to Rodney Rocha, who the day before had carried forward the Debris Assessment 
Teamʼs request for imaging, stated the following.

“… FYI, According to the MER, Ralph Roe has told program that Orbiter is not requesting 
any outside imaging help …” [MER=Mission Evaluation Room]

Earlier that morning, Ralph Roeʼs deputy manager, Trish Petite, had separate conversations 
with Paul Shack and tile expert Calvin Schomburg. In those conversations, Petite noted that 
an analysis of potential damage was in progress, and they should wait to see what the analysis 
showed before asking for imagery. Schomburg, though aware of the Debris Assessment Teamʼs 
request for imaging, told Shack and Petite that he believed on-orbit imaging of potentially dam-
aged areas was not necessary. 

As the morning wore on, Debris Assessment Team engineers, Shuttle Program management, 
and other NASA personnel exchanged e-mail. Most messages centered on technical matters 
to be discussed at the Debris Assessment Teamʼs afternoon meeting, including debris density, 
computer-aided design models, and the highest angle of incidence to use for a particular mate-
rial property. One e-mail from Rocha to his managers and other Johnson engineers at 11:19 
a.m., included the following.

“… there are good scenarios (acceptable and minimal damage) to horrible ones, depend-
ing on the extent of the damage incurred by the wing and location. The most critical loca-

tions seem to be the 1191 wing spar region, the main landing gear door seal, and the RCC 
panels. We do not know yet the exact extent or nature of the damage without being provided 
better images, and without such all the high powered analyses and assessments in work 
will retain significant uncertainties …” 

 
Second Debris Assessment Team Meeting

Some but not all of the engineers attending the Debris Assessment Teamʼs second meeting had 
learned that the Shuttle Program was not pursuing imaging of potentially damaged areas. What 
team members did not realize was the Shuttle Programʼs decision not to seek on-orbit imagery 
was not necessarily a direct and final response to their request. Rather, the “no” was partly in 
response to the Kennedy Space Center action initiated by United Space Alliance engineers and 
managers and finally by Wayne Hale. 

Not knowing that this was the case, Debris Assessment Team members speculated as to why 
their request was rejected and whether their analysis was worth pursuing without new imagery. 
Discussion then moved on to whether the Debris Assessment Team had a “mandatory need” for 
Department of Defense imaging. Most team members, when asked by the Board what “manda-
tory need” meant, replied with a shrug of their shoulders. They believed the need for imagery 
was obvious: without better pictures, engineers would be unable to make reliable predictions of 
the depth and area of damage caused by a foam strike that was outside of the experience base. 
However, team members concluded that although their need was important, they could not cite 
a “mandatory” requirement for the request. Analysts on the Debris Assessment Team were in the 
unenviable position of wanting images to more accurately assess damage while simultaneously 
needing to prove to Program managers, as a result of their assessment, that there was a need 
for images in the first place.

After the meeting adjourned, Rocha read the 11:45 a.m. e-mail from Paul Shack, which said that 
the Orbiter Project was not requesting any outside imaging help. Rocha called Shack to ask if 
Shackʼs boss, Johnson Space Center engineering director Frank Benz, knew about the request. 
Rocha then sent several e-mails consisting of questions about the ongoing analyses and details 
on the Shuttle Programʼs cancellation of the imaging request. An e-mail that he did not send but 
instead printed out and shared with a colleague follows. 

“In my humble technical opinion, this is the wrong (and bordering on irresponsible) an-
swer from the SSP and Orbiter not to request additional imaging help from any outside 
source. I must emphasize (again) that severe enough damage (3 or 4 multiple tiles knocked 
out down to the densification layer) combined with the heating and resulting damage to the 
underlying structure at the most critical location (viz., MLG door/wheels/tires/hydraulics 
or the X1191 spar cap) could present potentially grave hazards. The engineering team will 
admit it might not achieve definitive high confidence answers without additional images, 
but, without action to request help to clarify the damage visually, we will guarantee it will 
not. Can we talk to Frank Benz before Fridayʼs MMT? Remember the NASA safety post-
ers everywhere around stating, ʻIf itʼs not safe, say soʼ? Yes, itʼs that serious.” [SSP=Space 
Shuttle Program, MLG=Main Landing Gear, MMT=Mission Management Team]

When asked why he did not send this e-mail, Rocha replied that he did not want to jump the 
chain of command. Having already raised the need to have the Orbiter imaged with Shack, he 
would defer to managementʼs judgment on obtaining imagery. 

Even after the imagery request had been cancelled by Program management, engineers in the 
Debris Assessment Team and Mission Control continued to analyze the foam strike. A structural 
engineer in the Mechanical, Maintenance, Arm and Crew Systems sent an e-mail to a flight 
dynamics engineer that stated: 

“There is lots of speculation as to extent of the damage, and we could get a burn through 
into the wheel well upon entry.” 

Less than an hour later, at 6:09 p.m., a Mission Evaluation Room Console log entry stated the 
following.

“MMACS is trying to view a Quicktime movie on the debris impact but doesnʼt have Quick-

us for help.” [MMACS=Mechanical, Maintenance, Arm and Crew Systems]

The  controller  at  the  Mechanical,  Maintenance, Arm  and  Crew  Systems  console  would  be 
among the first in Mission Control to see indications of burn-through during Columbiaʼs re-en-
try on the morning of February 1. This log entry also indicates that Mission Control personnel 
were aware of the strike.

Flight Day Eight, Thursday, January 23, 2003

The morning after Shuttle Program Management decided not to pursue on-orbit imagery, Rod-
ney Rocha received a return call from Mission Operations Directorate representative Barbara 
Conte to discuss what kinds of imaging capabilities were available for STS-107. 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY 7

Conte explained to Rocha that the Mission Operations Directorate at Johnson did have U.S. 
Air Force standard services for imaging the Shuttle during Solid Rocket Booster separation 
and External Tank separation. Conte explained that the Orbiter would probably have to fly over 
Hawaii to be imaged. The Board notes that this statement illustrates an unfamiliarity with Na-
tional imaging assets. Hawaii is only one of many sites where relevant assets are based. Conte 
asked Rocha if he wanted her to pursue such a request through Missions Operations Directorate 
channels. Rocha said no, because he believed Program managers would still have to support 
such a request. Since they had already decided that imaging of potentially damaged areas was 
not necessary, Rocha thought it unlikely that the Debris Assessment Team could convince them 
otherwise without definitive data. 

Later that day, Conte and another Mission Operations Directorate representative were attending 
an unrelated meeting with Leroy Cain, the STS-107 ascent/entry Flight Director. At that meet-
ing, they conveyed Rochaʼs concern to Cain and offered to help with obtaining imaging. After 
checking with Phil Engelauf, Cain distributed the following e-mail.

Help with debris hit

The SSP was asked directly if they had any interest/desire in requesting resources outside of NASA 
to view the Orbiter (ref. the wing leading edge debris concern).

They said, No.

After talking to Phil, I consider it to be a dead issue.

[SSP=Space Shuttle Program]

Also on Flight Day Eight, Debris Assessment Team engineers presented their final debris trajec-
tory estimates to their NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing managers. These estimates 
formed the basis for predicting the Orbiterʼs damaged areas as well as the extent of damage, 
which in turn determined the ultimate threat to the Orbiter during re-entry.

Mission Control personnel thought they should tell Commander Rick Husband and Pilot Wil-
liam McCool about the debris strike, not because they thought that it was worthy of the crewʼs 
attention but because the crew might be asked about it in an upcoming media interview. Flight 
Director Steve Stitch sent the following e-mail to Husband and McCool and copied other Flight 
Directors.

INFO: Possible PAO Event Question

Rick and Willie,

You guys are doing a fantastic job staying on the timeline and accomplishing great science. Keep up 
the good work and let us know if there is anything that we can do better from an MCC/POCC stand-
point.

There is one item that I would like to make you aware of for the upcoming PAO event on Blue FD 
10 and for future PAO events later in the mission. This item is not even worth mentioning other than 
wanting to make sure that you are not surprised by it in a question from a reporter.

During ascent at approximately 80 seconds, photo analysis shows that some debris from the area of 
the -Y ET Bipod Attach Point came loose and subsequently impacted the orbiter left wing, in the area 
of transition from Chine to Main Wing, creating a shower of smaller particles. The impact appears 
to be totally on the lower surface and no particles are seen to traverse over the upper surface of the 
wing. Experts have reviewed the high speed photography and there is no concern for RCC or tile 
damage. We have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no 
concern for entry. 

That is all for now. It’s a pleasure working with you every day. 

[MCC/POCC=Mission Control Center/Payload Operations Control Center, PAO=Public Affairs Officer, FD 10=Flight Day 
Ten, -Y=left, ET=External Tank]

This e-mail was followed by another to the crew with an attachment of the video showing the 
debris impact. Husband acknowledged receipt of these messages.

Later, a NASA liaison to USSTRATCOM sent an e-mail thanking personnel for the prompt 
response to the imagery request. The e-mail asked that they help NASA observe “official chan-
nels” for this type of support in the future. Excerpts from this message follow.

“Let me assure you that, as of yesterday afternoon, the Shuttle was in excellent shape, 
mission  objectives  were  being  performed,  and  that  there  were  no  major  debris  system 
problems identified. The request that you received was based on a piece of debris, most 
likely ice or insulation from the ET, that came off shortly after launch and hit the underside 
of the vehicle. Even though this is not a common occurrence it is something that has hap-
pened before and is not considered to be a major problem. The one problem that this has 
identified is the need for some additional coordination within NASA to assure that when a 
request is made it is done through the official channels. The NASA/ USSTRAT (USSPACE) 
MOA identifies the need for this type of support and that it will be provided by USSTRAT. 
Procedures have been long established that identifies the Flight Dynamics Officer (for the 
Shuttle) and the Trajectory Operations Officer (for the International Space Station) as the 
POCs to work these issues with the personnel in Cheyenne Mountain. One of the primary 
purposes for this chain is to make sure that requests like this one does not slip through the 
system and spin the community up about potential problems that have not been fully vet-
ted through the proper channels. Two things that you can help us with is to make sure that 
future requests of this sort are confirmed through the proper channels. For the Shuttle it 
is via CMOC to the Flight Dynamics Officer. For the International Space Station it is via 
CMOC to the Trajectory Operations Officer. The second request is that no resources are 
spent unless the request has been confirmed. These requests are not meant to diminish the 
responsibilities of the DDMS office or to change any previous agreements but to eliminate 
the  confusion  that  can  be  caused  by  a  lack  of  proper  coordination.”  [ET=External  Tank,

Third Debris Assessment Team Meeting 

The Debris Assessment Team met for the third time Thursday afternoon to review updated 
impact analyses. Engineers noted that there were no alternate re-entry trajectories that the Or-
biter could fly to substantially reduce heating in the general area of the foam strike. Engineers 
also presented final debris trajectory data that included three debris size estimates to cover 
the continuing uncertainty about the size of the debris. Team members were told that imaging 
would not be forthcoming. In the face of this denial, the team discussed whether to include a 
presentation slide supporting their desire for images of the potentially damaged area. Many still 
felt it was a valid request and wanted their concerns aired at the upcoming Mission Evaluation 
Room brief and then at the Mission Management Team level. Eventually, the idea of including 
a presentation slide about the imaging request was dropped. 

Just prior to attending the third assessment meeting, tile expert Calvin Schomburg and Rod-
ney  Rocha  met  to  discuss  foam  impacts  from  other  missions.  Schomburg  implied  that  the 
STS-107 foam impact was in the Orbiterʼs experience base and represented only a maintenance 
issue. Rocha disagreed and argued about the potential for burn-through on re-entry. Calvin 
Schomburg stated a belief that if there was severe damage to the tiles, “nothing could be done.” 
(See Section 6.4.) Both then joined the meeting already in progress.

According to Boeing analysts who were members of the Debris Assessment Team, Schomburg 
called to ask about their rationale for pursuing imagery. The Boeing analysts told him that 
something the size of a large cooler had hit the Orbiter at 500 miles per hour. Pressed for ad-
ditional reasons and not fully understanding why their original justification was insufficient, 
the analysts said that at least they would know what happened if something were to go terribly 
wrong. The Boeing analysts next asked why they were working so hard analyzing potential 
damage areas if Shuttle Program management believed the damage was minor and that no 
safety-of-flight issues existed. Schomburg replied that the analysts were new and would learn 
from this exercise. 

Flight Day Nine, Friday, January 24, 2003 

At 7:00 a.m., Boeing and United Space Alliance contract personnel presented the Debris As-
sessment Teamʼs findings to Don McCormack, the Mission Evaluation Room manager. In yet 
another signal that working engineers and mission personnel shared a high level of concern for 
Columbiaʼs condition, so many engineers crowded the briefing room that it was standing room 
only, with people lining the hallway. 

The presentation included viewgraphs that discussed the teamʼs analytical methodology and 
five scenarios for debris damage, each based on different estimates of debris size and impact 
point. A sixth scenario had not yet been completed, but early indications suggested that it would 
not differ significantly from the other five. Each case was presented with a general overview 
of transport mechanics, results from the Crater modeling, aerothermal considerations, and pre-
dicted thermal and structural effects for Columbiaʼs re-entry. The briefing focused primarily on 
potential damage to the tiles, not the RCC panels. (An analysis of how the poor construction 
of these viewgraphs effectively minimized key assumptions and uncertainties is presented in 
Chapter 7.)

While the team members were confident that they had conducted the analysis properly – with-
in the limitations of the information they had – they stressed that many uncertainties remained. 
First, there was great uncertainty about where the debris had struck. Second, Crater, the analyt-
ical tool they used to predict the penetration depth of debris impact, was being used on a piece 
of debris that was 400 times larger than the standard in Boeingʼs database. (At the time, the 
team believed that the debris was 640 times larger.) Engineers ultimately concluded that their 
analysis, limited as it was, did not show that a safety-of-flight issue existed. Engineers who 
attended this briefing indicated a belief that management focused on the answer – that analysis 
proved there was no safety-of-flight issue – rather than concerns about the large uncertainties 
that may have undermined the analysis that provided that answer.

At the Mission Management Teamʼs 8:00 a.m. meeting, Mission Evaluation Room manager 
Don McCormack verbally summarized the Debris Assessment Teamʼs 7:00 a.m. brief. It was 
the third topic discussed. Unlike the earlier briefing, McCormackʼs presentation did not include 
the Debris Assessment Teamʼs presentation charts. The Board notes that no supporting analysis 
or examination of minority engineering views was asked for or offered, that neither Mission 
Evaluation Room nor Mission Management Team members requested a technical paper of the 
Debris Assessment Team analysis, and that no technical questions were asked. 

January 24, 2003, Mission Management Team Meeting Transcript

The  following  is  a  transcript  of  McCormackʼs  verbal  briefing  to  the  Mission  Management 
Team, which Linda Ham Chaired. Early in the meeting, Phil Engelauf, Chief of the Flight 
Directorʼs office, reported that he had made clear in an e-mail to Columbiaʼs crew that there 
were “no concerns” that the debris strike had caused serious damage. The Board notes that this 
conclusion about whether the debris strike posed a safety-of-flight issue was presented to Mis-
sion Management Team members before they discussed the debris strike damage assessment. 

Engelauf: “I will say that crew did send down a note last night asking if anybody is talking 
about extension days or going to go with that and we sent up to the crew about a 15 second 
video clip of the strike just so they are armed if they get any questions at the press conferences 
or that sort of thing, but we made it very clear to them no, no concerns.”

Linda Ham: “When is the press conference? Is it today?”

Engelauf: “Itʼs later today.” 

Ham: “They may get asked because the press is aware of it.”

Engelauf: “The press is aware of it I know folks have asked me because the press corps at the 
cape have been asking…wanted to make sure they were properly…”

Ham: “Okay, back on the temperature…”

The meeting went on for another 25 minutes. Other mission-related subjects were discussed 
before team members returned to the debris strike.

Ham: “Go ahead, Don.”

Don McCormack: “Okay. And also weʼve received the data from the systems integration guys 
of the potential ranges of sizes and impact angles and where it might have hit. And the guys 
have gone off and done an analysis, they use a tool they refer to as Crater which is their official 
evaluation tool to determine the potential size of the damage. So they went off and done all that 
work and theyʼve done thermal analysis to the areas where there may be damaged tiles. The 
analysis is not complete. There is one case yet that they wish to run, but kind of just jumping to 
the conclusion of all that, they do show that, obviously, a potential for significant tile damage 
here, but thermal analysis does not indicate that there is potential for a burn-through. I mean 
there could be localized heating damage. There is… obviously there is a lot of uncertainty in 
all this in terms of the size of the debris and where it hit and the angle of incidence.”

Ham: “No burn through, means no catastrophic damage and the localized heating damage 
would mean a tile replacement?”

McCormack: “Right, it would mean possible impacts to turnaround repairs and that sort of 
thing, but we do not see any kind of safety of flight issue here yet in anything that weʼve looked 
at.”

Ham: “And no safety of flight, no issue for this mission, nothing that weʼre going to do different, 
there may be a turnaround.”

McCormack: “Right, it could potentially hit the RCC and we donʼt indicate any other possible 
coating damage or something, we donʼt see any issue if it hit the RCC. Although we could have 
some significant tile damage if we donʼt see a safety-of-flight issue.”

Ham: “What do you mean by that?”

McCormack: “Well it could be down through the … we could lose an entire tile and then the 
ramp into and out of that, I mean it could be a significant area of tile damage down to the SIP 
perhaps, so it could be a significant piece missing, but…” [SIP refers to the denser lower layers of 
tile to which the debris may have penetrated.]

Ham.: “It would be a turnaround issue only?”

McCormack: “Right.”

(Unintelligible speaker) 

At this point, tile expert Calvin Schomburg states his belief that no safety-of-flight issue exists. 
However, some participants listening via teleconference to the meeting are unable to hear his 
comments.

Ham: “Okay. Same thing you told me about the other day in my office. Weʼve seen pieces of this 
size before havenʼt we?”

Unknown speaker. “Hey Linda, weʼre missing part of that conversation.” 

Ham: “Right.”

Unknown speaker: “Linda, we canʼt hear the speaker.”

Ham: “He was just reiterating with Calvin that he doesnʼt believe that there is any burn-through 
so no safety of flight kind of issue, itʼs more of a turnaround issue similar to what weʼve had on 
other flights. Thatʼs it? Alright, any questions on that?”

The Board notes that when the official minutes of the January 24 Mission Management Team 
were produced and distributed, there was no mention of the debris strike. These minutes were 
approved and signed by Frank Moreno, STS-107 Lead Payload Integration Manager, and Linda 
Ham. For anyone not present at the January 24 Mission Management Team who was relying on 
the minutes to update them on key issues, they would have read nothing about the debris-strike 
discussions between Don McCormack and Linda Ham.

A subsequent 8:59 a.m. Mission Evaluation Room console log entry follows.

“MMT Summary…McCormack also summarized the debris assessment. Bottom line is that 
there appears to be no safety of flight issue, but good chance of turnaround impact to repair 
tile damage.” [MMT=Mission Management Team]

Flight Day 10 through 16, Saturday through Friday, January 25 through 31, 2003

Although “no safety-of-flight issue” had officially been noted in the Mission Evaluation Room 
log, the Debris Assessment Team was still working on parts of its analysis of potential damage 
to the wing and main landing gear door. On Sunday, January 26, Rodney Rocha spoke with a 
Boeing thermal analyst and a Boeing stress analyst by telephone to express his concern about 
the Debris Assessment Teamʼs overall analysis, as well as the remaining work on the main land-
ing gear door analysis. After the Boeing engineers stated their confidence with their analyses, 
Rocha became more comfortable with the damage assessment and sent the following e-mail to 
his management.

STS-107 Wing Debris Impact on Ascent: Final analysis case completed

Cc: 

Subject: 

As you recall from Friday’s briefing to the MER, there remained open work to assess analytically 
predicted impact damage to the wing underside in the region of the main landing gear door. This area 
was considered a low probability hit area by the image analysis teams, but they admitted a debris 
strike here could not be ruled out. 

As with the other analyses performed and reported on Friday, this assessment by the Boeing multi-
technical discipline engineering teams also employed the system integration’s dispersed trajectories 
followed by serial results from the Crater damage prediction tool, thermal analysis, and stress analy-
sis. It was reviewed and accepted by the ES-DCE (R. Rocha) by Sunday morning, Jan. 26. The case 
is defined by a large area gouge about 7 inch wide and about 30 inch long with sloped sides like a 
crater, and reaching down to the densified layer of the TPS. 

SUMMARY: Though this case predicted some higher temperatures at the outer layer of the hon-
eycomb aluminum face sheet and subsequent debonding of the sheet, there is no predicted burn-
through of the door, no breeching of the thermal and gas seals, nor is there door structural deforma-
tion or thermal warpage to open the seal to hot plasma intrusion. Though degradation of the TPS and 
door structure is likely (if the impact occurred here), there is no safety of flight (entry, descent, land-
ing) issue. 

Note to Don M. and Fred O.: On Friday I believe the MER was thoroughly briefed and it was clear that 
open work remained (viz., the case summarized above), the message of open work was not clearly 
given, in my opinion, to Linda Ham at the MMT. I believe we left her the impression that engineering 
assessments and cases were all finished and we could state with finality no safety of flight issues or 
questions remaining. This very serious case could not be ruled out and it was a very good thing we 
carried it through to a finish.

In response to this e-mail, Don McCormack told Rocha that he would make sure to correct 
Linda Hamʼs possible misconception that the Debris Assessment Teamʼs analysis was finished 
as of the briefing to the Mission Management Team. McCormack informed Ham at the next 
Mission Management Team meeting on January 27, that the damage assessment had in fact 
been ongoing and that their final conclusion was that no safety-of-flight issue existed. The de-
bris strike, in the official estimation of the Debris Assessment Team, amounted to only a post-
landing turn-around maintenance issue.

On Monday morning, January 27, Doug Drewry, a structural engineering manager from John-
son Space Center, summoned several Johnson engineers and Rocha to his office and asked them 
if they all agreed with the completed analyses and with the conclusion that no safety-of-flight 
issues existed. Although all participants agreed with that conclusion, they also knew that the 
Debris Assessment Team members and most structural engineers at Johnson still wanted im-
ages of Columbiaʼs left wing but had given up trying to make that desire fit the “mandatory” 
requirement that Shuttle management had set.

Langley Research Center

Although the Debris Analysis Team had completed its analysis and rendered a “no safety-of-
flight” verdict, concern persisted among engineers elsewhere at NASA as they learned about 
the debris strike and potential damage. On Monday, January 27, Carlisle Campbell, the design 
engineer responsible for landing gear/tires/brakes at Johnson Space Center forwarded Rodney 
Rochaʼs January 26, e-mail to Bob Daugherty, an engineer at Langley Research Center who 
specialized in landing gear design. Engineers at Langley and Ames Research Center and John-
son Space Center did not entertain the possibility of Columbia breaking up during re-entry, 
but rather focused on the idea that landing might not be safe, and that the crew might need to 
“ditch” the vehicle (crash land in water) or be prepared to land with damaged landing gear.

Campbell initially contacted Daugherty to ask his opinion of the arguments used to declare the 
debris strike “not a safety-of-flight issue.” Campbell commented that someone had brought up 
worst-case scenarios in which a breach in the main landing gear door causes two tires to go flat. 
To help Daugherty understand the problem, Campbell forwarded him e-mails, briefing slides, 
and film clips from the debris damage analysis.

Both engineers felt that the potential ramifications of landing with two flat tires had not been 
sufficiently explored. They discussed using Shuttle simulator facilities at Ames Research Cen-
ter to simulate a landing with two flat tires, but initially ruled it out because there was no formal 
request from the Mission Management Team to work the problem. Because astronauts were 
training in the Ames simulation facility, the two engineers looked into conducting the simula-
tions after hours. Daugherty contacted his management on Tuesday, January 28, to update them 
on the plan for after-hours simulations. He reviewed previous data runs, current simulation 
results, and prepared scenarios that could result from main landing gear problems.

The simulated landings with two flat tires that Daugherty eventually conducted indicated that it 
was a survivable but very serious malfunction. Of the various scenarios he prepared, Daugherty 
shared the most unfavorable only with his management and selected Johnson Space Center 
engineers. In contrast, his favorable simulation results were forwarded to a wider Johnson audi-
ence for review, including Rodney Rocha and other Debris Assessment Team members. The 
Board is disappointed that Daughertyʼs favorable scenarios received a wider distribution than 
his discovery of a potentially serious malfunction, and also does not approve of the reticence 
that he and his managers displayed in not notifying the Mission Management Team of their 
concerns or his assumption that they could not displace astronauts who were training in the 
Ames simulator.

At 4:36 p.m. on Monday, January 27, Daugherty sent the following to Campbell.

WOW!!!
I bet there are a few pucker strings pulled tight around there!
Thinking about a belly landing versus bailout...... (I would say that if there is a question about main 
gear well burn thru that its crazy to even hit the deploy gear button...the reason being that you might 
have failed the wheels since they are aluminum..they will fail before the tire heating/pressure makes 
them fail..and you will send debris all over the wheel well making it a possibility that the gear would 
not even deploy due to ancillary damage...300 feet is the wrong altitude to find out you have one gear 
down and the other not down...you’re dead in that case)
Think about the pitch-down moment for a belly landing when hitting not the main gear but the trailing 
edge of the wing or body flap when landing gear up...even if you come in fast and at slightly less pitch 
attitude...the nose slapdown with that pitching moment arm seems to me to be pretty scary...so much 
so that I would bail out before I would let a loved one land like that.
My two cents.
See ya,
Bob

Thanks. That’s why they need to get all the facts in early on--such as look at impact damage from the 
spy telescope. Even then, we may not know the real effect of the damage.
 
The LaRC ditching model tests 20 some years ago showed that the Orbiter was the best ditching 
shape that they had ever tested, of many. But, our structures people have said that if we ditch we 
would blow such big holes in the lower panels that the orbiter might break up. Anyway, they refuse to 
even consider water ditching any more--I still have the test results[ Bailout seems best.

Carlisle Campbell sent the following e-mail to Johnson Space Center engineering managers on 
January 31. 

“In order to alleviate concerns regarding the worst case scenario which could potentially 
be caused by the debris impact under the Orbiterʼs left wing during launch, EG conducted 
some landing simulations on the Ames Vertical Motion Simulator which tested the ability 
of the crew and vehicle to survive a condition where two main gear tires are deflated before 
landing. The results, although limited, showed that this condition is controllable, including 
the nose slap down rates. These results may give MOD a different decision path should 
this scenario become a reality. Previous opinions were that bailout was the only answer.”

In the Mission Evaluation Room, a safety representative from Science Applications Interna-
tional Corporation, NASAʼs contract safety company, made a log entry at the Safety and Quality 
Assurance console on January 28, at 12:15 p.m. It was only the second mention of the debris 
strike in the safety console log during the mission (the first was also minor).

“[MCC SAIC] called asking if any SR&QA people were involved in the decision to say that 
the ascent debris hit (left wing) is safe. [SAIC engineer] has indeed been involved in the 
analysis and stated that he concurs with the analysis. Details about the debris hit are found 
in the Flight Day 12 MER Manager and our Daily Report.” [MCC=Mission Control Center,

MISSED OPPORTUNITY 8

According to a Memorandum for the Record written by William Readdy, Associate Administra-
tor for Space Flight, Readdy and Michael Card, from NASAʼs Safety and Mission Assurance 
Office, discussed an offer of Department of Defense imagery support for Columbia. This Janu-
ary 29, conversation ended with Readdy telling Card that NASA would accept the offer but 
because the Mission Management Team had concluded that this was not a safety-of-flight issue, 
the imagery should be gathered only on a low priority “not-to-interfere” basis. Ultimately, no 
imagery was taken.

The Board notes that at the January 31, Mission Management Team meeting, there was only a 
minor mention of the debris strike. Other issues discussed included onboard crew consumables, 
the status of the leaking water separator, an intercom anomaly, SPACEHAB water flow rates, 
an update of the status of onboard experiments, end-of-mission weight concerns, landing day 
weather forecasts, and landing opportunities. The only mention of the debris strike was a brief 
comment by Bob Page, representing Kennedy Space Centerʼs Launch Integration Office, who 
stated that the crewʼs hand-held cameras and External Tank films would be expedited to Mar-
shall Space Flight Center via the Shuttle Training Aircraft for post-flight foam/debris imagery 
analysis, per Linda Hamʼs request.

Summary: Mission Management Decision Making 

Discovery and Initial Analysis of Debris Strike

In the course of examining film and video images of Columbiaʼs ascent, the Intercenter Photo 
Working Group identified, on the day after launch, a large debris strike to the leading edge 
of Columbiaʼs left wing. Alarmed at seeing so severe a hit so late in ascent, and at not hav-
ing a clear view of damage the strike might have caused, Intercenter Photo Working Group 
members alerted senior Program managers by phone and sent a digitized clip of the strike 
to hundreds of NASA personnel via e-mail. These actions initiated a contingency plan that 
brought together an interdisciplinary group of experts from NASA, Boeing, and the United 
Space Alliance to analyze the strike. So concerned were Intercenter Photo Working Group 
personnel that on the day they discovered the debris strike, they tapped their Chair, Bob Page, 
to see through a request to image the left wing with Department of Defense assets in anticipa-
tion of analysts needing these images to better determine potential damage. By the Boardʼs 
count, this would be the first of three requests to secure imagery of Columbia on-orbit during 
the 16-day mission.

imaging request with William Readdy, Associate Administrator for Space Flight. Readdy directs

Upon learning of the debris strike on Flight Day Two, the responsible system area manager 
from United Space Alliance and her NASA counterpart formed a team to analyze the debris 
strike in accordance with mission rules requiring the careful examination of any “out-of-fam-
ily” event. Using film from the Intercenter Photo Working Group, Boeing systems integration 
analysts prepared a preliminary analysis that afternoon. (Initial estimates of debris size and 
speed, origin of debris, and point of impact would later prove remarkably accurate.) 

As Flight Day Three and Four unfolded over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, en-
gineers began their analysis. One Boeing analyst used Crater, a mathematical prediction tool, 
to assess possible damage to the Thermal Protection System. Analysis predicted tile damage 
deeper than the actual tile depth, and penetration of the RCC coating at impact angles above 
15 degrees. This suggested the potential for a burn-through during re-entry. Debris Assessment 
Team members judged that the actual damage would not be as severe as predicted because of 
the inherent conservatism in the Crater model and because, in the case of tile, Crater does not 
take into account the tileʼs stronger and more impact-resistant “densified” layer, and in the 
case of RCC, the lower density of foam would preclude penetration at impact angles under 21 
degrees.

On Flight Day Five, impact assessment results for tile and RCC were presented at an informal 
meeting of the Debris Assessment Team, which was operating without direct Shuttle Program 
or Mission Management leadership. Mission Controlʼs engineering support, the Mission Evalu-
ation Room, provided no direction for team activities other than to request the teamʼs results 
by January 24. As the problem was being worked, Shuttle managers did not formally direct 
the actions of or consult with Debris Assessment Team leaders about the teamʼs assumptions, 
uncertainties, progress, or interim results, an unusual circumstance given that NASA managers 
are normally engaged in analyzing what they view as problems. At this meeting, participants 
agreed that an image of the area of the wing in question was essential to refine their analysis and 
reduce the uncertainties in their damage assessment. 

Each member supported the idea to seek imagery from an outside source. Due in part to a lack 
of guidance from the Mission Management Team or Mission Evaluation Room managers, the 
Debris Assessment Team chose an unconventional route for its request. Rather than working 
the request up the normal chain of command – through the Mission Evaluation Room to the 
Mission Management Team for action to Mission Control – team members nominated Rodney 
Rocha, the teamʼs Co-Chair, to pursue the request through the Engineering Directorate at John-
son Space Center. As a result, even after the accident the Debris Assessment Teamʼs request was 
viewed by Shuttle Program managers as a non-critical engineering desire rather than a critical 
operational need.

When the team learned that the Mission Management Team was not pursuing on-orbit imag-
ing, members were concerned. What Debris Assessment Team members did not realize was 
the negative response from the Program was not necessarily a direct and final response to their 
official request. Rather, the “no” was in part a response to requests for imagery initiated by the 
Intercenter Photo Working Group at Kennedy on Flight Day 2 in anticipation of analystsʼ needs 
that had become by Flight Day 6 an actual engineering request by the Debris Assessment Team, 
made informally through Bob White to Lambert Austin, and formally through Rodney Rochaʼs 
e-mail to Paul Shack. Even after learning that the Shuttle Program was not going to provide the 
team with imagery, some members sought information on how to obtain it anyway.

Debris Assessment Team members believed that imaging of potentially damaged areas was 
necessary even after the January 24, Mission Management Team meeting, where they had re-
ported their results. Why they did not directly approach Shuttle Program managers and share 
their concern and uncertainty, and why Shuttle Program managers claimed to be isolated from 
engineers, are points that the Board labored to understand. Several reasons for this communica-
tions failure relate to NASAʼs internal culture and the climate established by Shuttle Program 
management, which are discussed in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8.

A Flawed Analysis

An inexperienced team, using a mathematical tool that was not designed to assess an impact 
of this estimated size, performed the analysis of the potential effect of the debris impact. Cra-
ter was designed for “in-family” impact events and was intended for day-of-launch analysis 
of debris impacts. It was not intended for large projectiles like those observed on STS-107. 
Crater initially predicted possible damage, but the Debris Assessment Team assumed, without 
theoretical or experimental validation, that because Crater is a conservative tool – that is, it pre-
dicts more damage than will actually occur – the debris would stop at the tileʼs densified layer, 
even though their experience did not involve debris strikes as large as STS-107ʼs. Crater-like 
equations were also used as part of the analysis to assess potential impact damage to the wing 
leading edge RCC. Again, the tool was used for something other than that for which it was 
designed; again, it predicted possible penetration; and again, the Debris Assessment Team used 
engineering arguments and their experience to discount the results. 

As a result of a transition of responsibility for Crater analysis from the Boeing Huntington 
Beach facility to the Houston-based Boeing office, the team that conducted the Crater analyses 
had been formed fairly recently, and therefore could be considered less experienced when com-
pared with the more senior Huntington Beach analysts. In fact, STS-107 was the first mission for 
which they were solely responsible for providing analysis with the Crater tool. Though post-ac-
cident interviews suggested that the training for the Houston Boeing analysts was of high quality 
and adequate in substance and duration, communications and theoretical understandings of the 
Crater model among the Houston-based team members had not yet developed to the standard of 
a more senior team. Due in part to contractual arrangements related to the transition, the Hous-
ton-based team did not take full advantage of the Huntington Beach engineersʼ experience.

At the January 24, Mission Management Team meeting at which the “no safety-of-flight” con-
clusion was presented, there was little engineering discussion about the assumptions made, and 
how the results would differ if other assumptions were used. 

Engineering solutions presented to management should have included a quantifiable range of 
uncertainty and risk analysis. Those types of tools were readily available, routinely used, and 
would have helped management understand the risk involved in the decision. Management, in 
turn, should have demanded such information. The very absence of a clear and open discussion 
of uncertainties and assumptions in the analysis presented should have caused management to 
probe further.

Shuttle Program Managementʼs Low Level of Concern

While the debris strike was well outside the activities covered by normal mission flight rules, 
Mission Management Team members and Shuttle Program managers did not treat the debris 
strike as an issue that required operational action by Mission Control. Program managers, from 
Ron Dittemore to individual Mission Management Team members, had, over the course of the 
Space Shuttle Program, gradually become inured to External Tank foam losses and on a funda-

COLUMBIA

A C C I D E N T   I N V E S T I G A T I O N   B O A R D

mental level did not believe foam striking the vehicle posed a critical threat to the Orbiter. In 
particular, Shuttle managers exhibited a belief that RCC panels are impervious to foam impacts. 
Even after seeing the video of Columbiaʼs debris impact, learning estimates of the size and 
location of the strike, and noting that a foam strike with sufficient kinetic energy could cause 
Thermal Protection System damage, managementʼs level of concern did not change.

The  opinions  of  Shuttle  Program  managers  and  debris  and  photo  analysts  on  the  potential 
severity of the debris strike diverged early in the mission and continued to diverge as the mis-
sion progressed, making it increasingly difficult for the Debris Assessment Team to have their 
concerns heard by those in a decision-making capacity. In the face of Mission managersʼ low 
level of concern and desire to get on with the mission, Debris Assessment Team members had 
to prove unequivocally that a safety-of-flight issue existed before Shuttle Program management 
would move to obtain images of the left wing. The engineers found themselves in the unusual 
position of having to prove that the situation was unsafe – a reversal of the usual requirement 
to prove that a situation is safe.

Other  factors  contributed  to  Mission  managementʼs  ability  to  resist  the  Debris Assessment 
Teamʼs concerns. A tile expert told managers during frequent consultations that strike damage 
was only a maintenance-level concern and that on-orbit imaging of potential wing damage was 
not necessary. Mission management welcomed this opinion and sought no others. This constant 
reinforcement of managersʼ pre-existing beliefs added another block to the wall between deci-
sion makers and concerned engineers. 

Another factor that enabled Mission managementʼs detachment from the concerns of their own 
engineers is rooted in the culture of NASA itself. The Board observed an unofficial hierarchy 
among NASA programs and directorates that hindered the flow of communications. The effects 
of this unofficial hierarchy are seen in the attitude that members of the Debris Assessment Team 
held. Part of the reason they chose the institutional route for their imagery request was that 
without direction from the Mission Evaluation Room and Mission Management Team, they felt 
more comfortable with their own chain of command, which was outside the Shuttle Program. 
Further, when asked by investigators why they were not more vocal about their concerns, De-
bris Assessment Team members opined that by raising contrary points of view about Shuttle 
mission safety, they would be singled out for possible ridicule by their peers and managers.

A Lack of Clear Communication

Communication did not flow effectively up to or down from Program managers. As it became 
clear during the mission that managers were not as concerned as others about the danger of the 
foam strike, the ability of engineers to challenge those beliefs greatly diminished. Managersʼ ten-
dency to accept opinions that agree with their own dams the flow of effective communications. 

After the accident, Program managers stated privately and publicly that if engineers had a safe-
ty concern, they were obligated to communicate their concerns to management. Managers did 
not seem to understand that as leaders they had a corresponding and perhaps greater obligation 
to create viable routes for the engineering community to express their views and receive infor-
mation. This barrier to communications not only blocked the flow of information to managers, 
but it also prevented the downstream flow of information from managers to engineers, leaving 
Debris Assessment Team members no basis for understanding the reasoning behind Mission 
Management Team decisions. 

The January 27 to January 31, phone and e-mail exchanges, primarily between NASA engi-
neers at Langley and Johnson, illustrate another symptom of the “cultural fence” that impairs 
open communications between mission managers and working engineers. These exchanges and 
the reaction to them indicated that during the evaluation of a mission contingency, the Mission 
Management Team failed to disseminate information to all system and technology experts who 
could be consulted. Issues raised by two Langley and Johnson engineers led to the development 
of “what-if” landing scenarios of the potential outcome if the main landing gear door sustained 
damaged. This led to behind-the-scenes networking by these engineers to use NASA facilities 
to make simulation runs of a compromised landing configuration. These engineers – who un-
derstood their systems and related technology – saw the potential for a problem on landing and 
ran it down in case the unthinkable occurred. But their concerns never reached the managers on 
the Mission Management Team that had operational control over Columbia.

A Lack of Effective Leadership

The Shuttle Program, the Mission Management Team, and through it the Mission Evaluation 
Room, were not actively directing the efforts of the Debris Assessment Team. These manage-
ment teams were not engaged in scenario selection or discussions of assumptions and did not 
actively  seek  status,  inputs,  or  even  preliminary  results  from  the  individuals  charged  with 
analyzing the debris strike. They did not investigate the value of imagery, did not intervene to 
consult the more experienced Crater analysts at Boeingʼs Huntington Beach facility, did not 
probe the assumptions of the Debris Assessment Teamʼs analysis, and did not consider actions 
to mitigate the effects of the damage on re-entry. Managersʼ claims that they didnʼt hear the 
engineersʼ concerns were due in part to their not asking or listening.

The Failure of Safetyʼs Role

As will be discussed in Chapter 7, safety personnel were present but passive and did not serve 
as a channel for the voicing of concerns or dissenting views. Safety representatives attended 
meetings of the Debris Assessment Team, Mission Evaluation Room, and Mission Management 
Team, but were merely party to the analysis process and conclusions instead of an independent 
source of questions and challenges. Safety contractors in the Mission Evaluation Room were 
only marginally aware of the debris strike analysis. One contractor did question the Debris As-
sessment Team safety representative about the analysis and was told that it was adequate. No 
additional inquiries were made. The highest-ranking safety representative at NASA headquar-
ters deferred to Program managers when asked for an opinion on imaging of Columbia. The 
safety manager he spoke to also failed to follow up. 

Summary

Management  decisions  made  during  Columbiaʼs  final  flight  reflect  missed  opportunities, 
blocked or ineffective communications channels, flawed analysis, and ineffective leadership. 
Perhaps most striking is the fact that management – including Shuttle Program, Mission Man-
agement Team, Mission Evaluation Room, and Flight Director and Mission Control – displayed 
no interest in understanding a problem and its implications. Because managers failed to avail 
themselves of the wide range of expertise and opinion necessary to achieve the best answer 
to the debris strike question – “Was this a safety-of-flight concern?” – some Space Shuttle 
Program managers failed to fulfill the implicit contract to do whatever is possible to ensure the 
safety of the crew. In fact, their management techniques unknowingly imposed barriers that 
kept at bay both engineering concerns and dissenting views, and ultimately helped create “blind 
spots” that prevented them from seeing the danger the foam strike posed. 

Because this chapter has focused on key personnel who participated in STS-107 bipod foam 
debris strike decisions, it is tempting to conclude that replacing them will solve all NASAʼs 
problems. However, solving NASAʼs problems is not quite so easily achieved. Peoplesʼ actions 
are influenced by the organizations in which they work, shaping their choices in directions that 
even they may not realize. The Board explores the organizational context of decision making 
more fully in Chapters 7 and 8.

The foam strike was first seen by the Intercenter Photo Working Group on the morn-
ing of Flight Day Two during the standard review of launch video and high-speed 
photography. The strike was larger than any seen in the past, and the group was 
concerned about possible damage to the Orbiter. No conclusive images of the strike 
existed. One camera that may have provided an additional view was out of focus 
because of an improperly maintained lens.
The Chair of the Intercenter Photo Working Group asked management to begin the 
process of getting outside imagery to help in damage assessment. This request, the 
first of three, began its journey through the management hierarchy on Flight Day 
Two.
The Intercenter Photo Working Group distributed its first report, including a digitized 
video clip and initial assessment of the strike, on Flight Day Two. This information

was widely disseminated to NASA and contractor engineers, Shuttle Program man-
agers, and Mission Operations Directorate personnel. 
Initial estimates of debris size, speed, and origin were remarkably accurate. Initial in-
formation available to managers stated that the debris originated in the left bipod area 
of the External Tank, was quite large, had a high velocity, and struck the underside of 
the left wing near its leading edge. The report stated that the debris could have hit the 
RCC or tile.

The Debris Assessment Team

F6.3-5 

F6.3-6

F6.3-9 

A Debris Assessment Team began forming on Flight Day two to analyze the impact. 
Once the debris strike was categorized as “out of family” by United Space Alliance, 
contractual obligations led to the Team being Co-Chaired by the cognizant contrac-
tor sub-system manager and her NASA counterpart. The team was not designated a 
Tiger Team by the Mission Evaluation Room or Mission Management Team.
Though the Team was clearly reporting its plans (and final results) through the Mis-
sion Evaluation Room to the Mission Management Team, no Mission manager ap-
peared to “own” the Teamʼs actions. The Mission Management Team, through the 
Mission  Evaluation  Room,  provided  no  direction  for  team  activities,  and  Shuttle 
managers did not formally consult the Teamʼs leaders about their progress or interim 
results.
During an organizational meeting, the Team discussed the uncertainty of the data 
and the value of on-orbit imagery to “bound” their analysis. In its first official meet-
ing the next day, the Team gave its NASA Co-Chair the action to request imagery of 
Columbia on-orbit. 
The Team routed its request for imagery through Johnson Space Centerʼs Engineer-
ing Directorate rather than through the Mission Evaluation Room to the Mission 
Management Team to the Flight Dynamics Officer, the channel used during a mis-
sion. This routing diluted the urgency of their request. Managers viewed it as a non-
critical engineering desire rather than a critical operational need. 
Team members never realized that managementʼs decision against seeking imagery 
was not intended as a direct or final response to their request.

F6.3-10  The  Teamʼs  assessment  of  possible  tile  damage  was  performed  using  an  impact 
simulation that was well outside Craterʼs test database. The Boeing analyst was inex-
perienced in the use of Crater and the interpretation of its results. Engineers with ex-
tensive Thermal Protection System expertise at Huntington Beach were not actively 
involved in determining if the Crater results were properly interpreted.

F6.3-11  Crater initially predicted tile damage deeper than the actual tile depth, but engineers 
used their judgment to conclude that damage would not penetrate the densified layer 
of tile. Similarly, RCC damage conclusions were based primarily on judgment and 
experience rather than analysis.
For  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  management  failures,  communication  break-
downs, inadequate imagery, inappropriate use of assessment tools, and flawed engi-
neering judgments, the damage assessments contained substantial uncertainties.

F6.3-13  The assumptions (and their uncertainties) used in the analysis were never presented 
or discussed in full to either the Mission Evaluation Room or the Mission Manage-
ment Team.

F6.3-14  While engineers and managers knew the foam could have struck RCC panels; the 
briefings on the analysis to the Mission Evaluation Room and Mission Management 
Team did not address RCC damage, and neither Mission Evaluation Room nor Mis-
sion Management Team managers asked about it.

Space Shuttle Program Management

F6.3-15  There were lapses in leadership and communication that made it difficult for en-
gineers  to  raise  concerns  or  understand  decisions.  Management  failed  to  actively 
engage in the analysis of potential damage caused by the foam strike.

F6.3-16  Mission Management Team meetings occurred infrequently (five times during a 16 

day mission), not every day, as specified in Shuttle Program management rules.
Shuttle Program Managers entered the mission with the belief, recently reinforced 
by the STS-113 Flight Readiness Review, that a foam strike is not a safety-of-flight 
issue.

F6.3-18  After Program managers learned about the foam strike, their belief that it would not 
be a problem was confirmed (early, and without analysis) by a trusted expert who was 
readily accessible and spoke from “experience.” No one in management questioned 
this conclusion.

F6.3-19  Managers asked “Whoʼs requesting the photos?” instead of assessing the merits of 
the request. Management seemed more concerned about the staff following proper 
channels (even while they were themselves taking informal advice) than they were 
about the analysis.

F6.3-20  No one in the operational chain of command for STS-107 held a security clearance 
that would enable them to understand the capabilities and limitations of National 
imagery resources.

F6.3-21  Managers associated with STS-107 began investigating the implications of the foam 

F6.3-22 

F6.3-23 

strike on the launch schedule, and took steps to expedite post-flight analysis.
Program managers required engineers to prove that the debris strike created a safety-
of-flight issue: that is, engineers had to produce evidence that the system was unsafe 
rather than prove that it was safe.
In both the Mission Evaluation Room and Mission Management Team meetings over 
the Debris Assessment Teamʼs results, the focus was on the bottom line – was there 
a safety-of-flight issue, or not? There was little discussion of analysis, assumptions, 
issues, or ramifications. 

Communication

F6.3-24  Communication did not flow effectively up to or down from Program managers.
F6.3-25  Three independent requests for imagery were initiated. 
F6.3-26  Much of Program managersʼ information came through informal channels, which 

prevented relevant opinion and analysis from reaching decision makers.
Program Managers did not actively communicate with the Debris Assessment Team. 
Partly as a result of this, the Team went through institutional, not mission-related, 
channels with its request for imagery, and confusion surrounded the origin of imag-
ery requests and their subsequent denial. 

F6.3-28  Communication was stifled by the Shuttle Program attempts to find out who had a 

F6.3-27 

“mandatory requirement” for imagery.

Safety Representativeʼs Role

F6.3-29 

Safety representatives from the appropriate organizations attended meetings of the 
Debris  Assessment  Team,  Mission  Evaluation  Room,  and  Mission  Management 
Team, but were passive, and therefore were not a channel through which to voice 
concerns or dissenting views.

Recommendation:

R6.3-1 

Implement an expanded training program in which the Mission Management Team 
faces  potential  crew  and  vehicle  safety  contingences  beyond  launch  and  ascent. 
These contingences should involve potential loss of Shuttle or crew, contain numer-
ous uncertainties and unknowns, and require the Mission Management Team to as-
semble and interact with support organizations across NASA/Contractor lines and in 
various locations.

R6.3-2  Modify the Memorandum of Agreement with the National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency (NIMA) to make the imaging of each Shuttle flight while on orbit a standard 
requirement.

6.4  POSSIBILITY OF RESCUE OR REPAIR 

To put the decisions made during the flight of STS-107 into 
perspective,  the  Board  asked  NASA  to  determine  if  there 
were options for the safe return of the STS-107 crew. In this 
study, NASA was to assume that the extent of damage to the 
leading  edge  of  the  left  wing  was  determined  by  national 
imaging assets or by a spacewalk. NASA was then asked to 
evaluate the possibility of: 

1.  Rescuing  the  STS-107  crew  by  launching  Atlantis. 
Atlantis would be hurried to the pad, launched, rendez-
vous with Columbia, and take on Columbiaʼs crew for 
a return. It was assumed that NASA would be willing 
to expose Atlantis and its crew to the same possibil-
ity  of  External  Tank  bipod  foam  loss  that  damaged 
Columbia. 

2.  Repairing damage to Columbiaʼs wing on orbit. In the 
repair scenario, astronauts would use onboard materi-
als to rig a temporary fix. Some of Columbiaʼs cargo 
might  be  jettisoned  and  a  different  re-entry  profile 
would be flown to lessen heating on the left wing lead-
ing edge. The crew would be prepared to bail out if the 
wing structure was predicted to fail on landing. 

In its study of these two options, NASA assumed the follow-
ing timeline. Following the debris strike discovery on Flight 
Day Two, Mission Managers requested imagery by Flight 
Day Three. That imagery was inconclusive, leading to a de-
cision on Flight Day Four to perform a spacewalk on Flight 
Day Five. That spacewalk revealed potentially catastrophic 
damage. The  crew  was  directed  to  begin  conserving  con-
sumables, such as oxygen and water, and Shuttle managers 
began around-the-clock processing of Atlantis to prepare it 
for launch. Shuttle managers pursued both the rescue and the 
repair options from Flight Day Six to Flight Day 26, and on 
that day (February 10) decided which one to abandon.

The  NASA  team  deemed  this  timeline  realistic  for  sev-
eral  reasons.  First,  the  team  determined  that  a  spacewalk 
to inspect the left wing could be easily accomplished. The 
team then assessed how the crew could limit its use of con-
sumables  to  determine  how  long  Columbia  could  stay  in 
orbit. The limiting consumable was the lithium hydroxide 
canisters, which scrub from the cabin atmosphere the carbon 
dioxide the crew exhales. After consulting with flight sur-
geons, the team concluded that by modifying crew activity 
and sleep time carbon dioxide could be kept to acceptable 
levels until Flight Day 30 (the morning of February 15). All 
other consumables would last longer. Oxygen, the next most 
critical, would require the crew to return on Flight Day 31. 

Repairing Damage On Orbit

The repair option (see Figure 6.4-1), while logistically vi-
able using existing materials onboard Columbia, relied on so 
many uncertainties that NASA rated this option “high risk.” 
To complete a repair, the crew would perform a spacewalk to 
fill an assumed 6-inch hole in an RCC panel with heavy met-
al tools, small pieces of titanium, or other metal scavenged 
from the crew cabin. These heavy metals, which would help 
protect  the  wing  structure,  would  be  held  in  place  during 

Figure 6.4-1. The speculative repair option would have sent astro-
nauts hanging over the payload bay door to reach the left wing 
RCC panels using a ladder scavenged from the crew module.

re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the 
cold of space. The ice and metal would help restore wing 
leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over 
the  wing  and  therefore  keeping  heating  and  burn-through 
levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail 
out before landing. Because the NASA team could not verify 
that the repairs would survive even a modified re-entry, the 
rescue option had a considerably higher chance of bringing 
Columbiaʼs crew back alive.

Rescuing the STS-107 Crew with Atlantis 

Accelerating the processing of Atlantis for early launch and 
rendezvous  with  Columbia  was  by  far  the  most  complex 
task in the rescue scenario. On Columbiaʼs Flight Day Four, 
Atlantis was in the Orbiter Processing Facility at Kennedy 
Space  Center  with  its  main  engines  installed  and  only  41 
days from its scheduled March 1 launch. The Solid Rocket 
Boosters were already mated with the External Tank in the 
Vehicle Assembly Building. By working three around-the-
clock shifts seven days a week, Atlantis could be readied for 
launch, with no necessary testing skipped, by February 10. 
If  launch  processing  and  countdown  proceeded  smoothly, 
this  would  provide  a  five-day  window,  from  February  10 
to  February  15,  in  which  Atlantis  could  rendezvous  with 
Columbia before Columbiaʼs consumables ran out. Accord-
ing to records, the weather on these days allowed a launch. 
Atlantis would be launched with a crew of four: a command-

er, pilot, and two astronauts trained for spacewalks. In Janu-
ary, seven commanders, seven pilots, and nine spacewalk-
trained astronauts were available. During the rendezvous on 
Atlantisʼs first day in orbit, the two Orbiters would maneuver 
to face each other with their payload bay doors open (see 
Figure 6.4-2). Suited Columbia crew members would then 
be  transferred  to  Atlantis  via  spacewalks.  Atlantis  would 
return with four crew members on the flight deck and seven 
in the mid-deck. Mission Control would then configure Co-
lumbia for a de-orbit burn that would ditch the Orbiter in the 
Pacific Ocean, or would have the Columbia crew take it to a 
higher orbit for a possible subsequent repair mission if more 
thorough repairs could be developed.

This  rescue  was  considered  challenging  but  feasible.  To 
succeed, it required problem-free processing of Atlantis and 
a flawless launch countdown. If Program managers had un-
derstood the threat that the bipod foam strike posed and were 
able  to  unequivocally  determine  before  Flight  Day  Seven 
that  there  was  potentially  catastrophic  damage  to  the  left 
wing, these repair and rescue plans would most likely have 
been developed, and a rescue would have been conceivable. 
For a detailed discussion of the rescue and repair options, 
see Appendix D.13.

was  potentially  catastrophic  damage  to  the  left 
wing,  accelerated  processing  of  Atlantis  might 
have provided a window in which Atlantis could 
rendezvous  with  Columbia  before  Columbiaʼs 
limited consumables ran out.

Recommendation:

R6.4-1 

 

 

 

For missions to the International Space Station, 
develop  a  practicable  capability  to  inspect  and 
effect  emergency  repairs  to  the  widest  possible 
range of damage to the Thermal Protection Sys-
tem, including both tile and Reinforced Carbon-
Carbon, taking advantage of the additional capa-
bilities available when near to or docked at the 
International Space Station.

For non-Station missions, develop a comprehen-
sive autonomous (independent of Station) inspec-
tion  and  repair  capability  to  cover  the  widest 
possible range of damage scenarios.

Accomplish  an  on-orbit  Thermal  Protection 
System inspection, using appropriate assets and 
capabilities, early in all missions.

The ultimate objective should be a fully autono-
mous  capability  for  all  missions  to  address  the 
possibility  that  an  International  Space  Station 
mission fails to achieve the correct orbit, fails to 
dock successfully, or is damaged during or after 
undocking.

CHAPTER 7

The Accidentʼs
Organizational Causes

Many  accident  investigations  make  the  same  mistake  in 
defining causes. They identify the widget that broke or mal-
functioned, then locate the person most closely connected 
with the technical failure: the engineer who miscalculated 
an analysis, the operator who missed signals or pulled the 
wrong switches, the supervisor who failed to listen, or the 
manager who made bad decisions. When causal chains are 
limited to technical flaws and individual failures, the ensu-
ing  responses  aimed  at  preventing  a  similar  event  in  the 
future are equally limited: they aim to fix the technical prob-
lem and replace or retrain the individual responsible. Such 
corrections  lead  to  a  misguided  and  potentially  disastrous 
belief  that  the  underlying  problem  has  been  solved.  The 
Board did not want to make these errors. A central piece of 
our expanded cause model involves NASA as an organiza-
tional whole.
ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSE STATEMENT

The organizational causes of this accident are rooted 
in  the  Space  Shuttle  Programʼs  history  and  culture, 
including  the  original  compromises  that  were  re-
quired  to  gain  approval  for  the  Shuttle  Program, 
subsequent years of resource constraints, fluctuating 
priorities, schedule pressures, mischaracterizations of 
the Shuttle as operational rather than developmental, 
and lack of an agreed national vision. Cultural traits 
and  organizational  practices  detrimental  to  safety 
and  reliability  were  allowed  to  develop,  including: 
reliance  on  past  success  as  a  substitute  for  sound 
engineering practices (such as testing to understand 
why systems were not performing in accordance with 
requirements/specifications); organizational barriers 
which  prevented  effective  communication  of  critical 
safety information and stifled professional differences 
of  opinion;  lack  of  integrated  management  across 
program elements; and the evolution of an informal 
chain  of  command  and  decision-making  processes 
that operated outside the organizationʼs rules.

UNDERSTANDING CAUSES

In  the  Boardʼs  view,  NASAʼs  organizational  culture  and 
structure had as much to do with this accident as the Exter-
nal Tank foam. Organizational culture refers to the values, 
norms, beliefs, and practices that govern how an institution 
functions.  At  the  most  basic  level,  organizational  culture 
defines the assumptions that employees make as they carry 
out their work. It is a powerful force that can persist through 
reorganizations and the reassignment of key personnel. 

Given that todayʼs risks in human space flight are as high 
and the safety margins as razor thin as they have ever been, 
there  is  little  room  for  overconfidence.  Yet  the  attitudes 
and  decision-making  of  Shuttle  Program  managers  and 
engineers during the events leading up to this accident were 
clearly overconfident and often bureaucratic in nature. They 
deferred to layered and cumbersome regulations rather than 
the  fundamentals  of  safety.  The  Shuttle  Programʼs  safety 
culture is straining to hold together the vestiges of a once 
robust systems safety program.

As the Board investigated the Columbia accident, it expected 
to find a vigorous safety organization, process, and culture at 
NASA, bearing little resemblance to what the Rogers Com-
mission identified as the ineffective “silent safety” system in 
which budget cuts resulted in a lack of resources, personnel, 
independence, and authority. NASAʼs initial briefings to the 
Board on its safety programs espoused a risk-averse philoso-
phy that empowered any employee to stop an operation at the 
mere glimmer of a problem. Unfortunately, NASAʼs views 
of its safety culture in those briefings did not reflect reality. 
Shuttle Program safety personnel failed to adequately assess 
anomalies  and  frequently  accepted  critical  risks  without 
qualitative  or  quantitative  support,  even  when  the  tools  to 
provide more comprehensive assessments were available. 

Similarly, the Board expected to find NASAʼs Safety and 
Mission Assurance  organization  deeply  engaged  at  every

level of Shuttle management: the Flight Readiness Review, 
the  Mission  Management  Team,  the  Debris  Assessment 
Team,  the  Mission  Evaluation  Room,  and  so  forth.  This 
was not the case. In briefing after briefing, interview after 
interview, NASA remained in denial: in the agencyʼs eyes, 
“there were no safety-of-flight issues,” and no safety com-
promises in the long history of debris strikes on the Ther-
mal Protection System. The silence of Program-level safety 
processes undermined oversight; when they did not speak 
up,  safety  personnel  could  not  fulfill  their  stated  mission 
to provide “checks and balances.” A pattern of acceptance 
prevailed  throughout  the  organization  that  tolerated  foam 
problems  without  sufficient  engineering  justification  for 
doing so. 

This chapter presents an organizational context for under-
standing the Columbia accident. Section 7.1 outlines a short 
history of safety at NASA, beginning in the pre-Apollo era 
when  the  agency  reputedly  had  the  finest  system  safety-
engineering  programs  in  the  world.  Section  7.2  discusses 
organizational theory and its importance to the Boardʼs in-
vestigation, and Section 7.3 examines the practices of three 
organizations that successfully manage high risk. Sections 
7.4 and 7.5 look at NASA today and answer the question, 
“How could NASA have missed the foam signal?” by high-
lighting the blind spots that rendered the Shuttle Programʼs 
risk perspective myopic. The Boardʼs conclusion and rec-
ommendations are presented in 7.6. (See Chapter 10 for a 
discussion of the differences between industrial safety and 
mission assurance/quality assurance.)
7.1  ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSES: INSIGHTS FROM 

HISTORY

NASAʼs organizational culture is rooted in history and tradi-
tion. From NASAʼs inception in 1958 to the Challenger ac-
cident in 1986, the agencyʼs Safety, Reliability, and Quality 
Assurance (SRQA) activities, “although distinct disciplines,” 
were “typically treated as one function in the design, devel-
opment,  and  operations  of  NASAʼs  manned  space  flight 
programs.”1 Contractors and NASA engineers collaborated 
closely to assure the safety of human space flight. Solid en-
gineering practices emphasized defining goals and relating 
system performance to them; establishing and using decision 
criteria; developing alternatives; modeling systems for analy-
sis; and managing operations.2 Although a NASA Office of 
Reliability  and  Quality Assurance  existed  for  a  short  time 
during the early 1960s, it was funded by the human space 
flight  program.  By  1963,  the  office  disappeared  from  the 
agencyʼs organization charts. For the next few years, the only 
type of safety program that existed at NASA was a decentral-
ized “loose federation” of risk assessment oversight run by 
each programʼs contractors and the project offices at each of 
the three Human Space Flight Centers. 

Fallout from Apollo – 1967

In  January  1967,  months  before  the  scheduled  launch  of 
Apollo  1,  three  astronauts  died  when  a  fire  erupted  in  a 
ground-test  capsule.  In  response,  Congress,  seeking  to 
establish  an  independent  safety  organization  to  oversee 
space flight, created the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 

(ASAP). The ASAP was intended to be a senior advisory 
committee to NASA, reviewing space flight safety studies 
and operations plans, and evaluating “systems procedures 
and  management  policies  that  contribute  to  risk.”  The 
panelʼs  main  priority  was  human  space  flight  missions.3 
Although four of the panelʼs nine members can be NASA 
employees,  in  recent  years  few  have  served  as  members. 
While the panelʼs support staff generally consists of full-
time NASA employees, the group technically remains an 
independent oversight body. 

Congress simultaneously mandated that NASA create sepa-
rate safety and reliability offices at the agencyʼs headquar-
ters and at each of its Human Space Flight Centers and Pro-
grams.  Overall  safety  oversight  became  the  responsibility 
of NASAʼs Chief Engineer. Although these offices were not 
totally independent – their funding was linked with the very 
programs they were supposed to oversee – their existence 
allowed NASA to treat safety as a unique function. Until the 
Challenger accident in 1986, NASA safety remained linked 
organizationally  and  financially  to  the  agencyʼs  Human 
Space Flight Program. 

Challenger – 1986 

In  the  aftermath  of  the  Challenger  accident,  the  Rogers 
Commission  issued  recommendations  intended  to  remedy 
what it considered to be basic deficiencies in NASAʼs safety 
system. These recommendations centered on an underlying 
theme: the lack of independent safety oversight at NASA. 
Without independence, the Commission believed, the slate 
of safety failures that contributed to the Challenger accident 
– such as the undue influence of schedule pressures and the 
flawed Flight Readiness process – would not be corrected. 
“NASA  should  establish  an  Office  of  Safety,  Reliability, 
and  Quality Assurance  to  be  headed  by  an Associate Ad-
ministrator, reporting directly to the NASA Administrator,” 
concluded the Commission. “It would have direct authority 
for safety, reliability, and quality assurance throughout the 
Agency.  The  office  should  be  assigned  the  workforce  to 
ensure  adequate  oversight  of  its  functions  and  should  be 
independent of other NASA functional and program respon-
sibilities” [emphasis added]. 

In July 1986, NASA Administrator James Fletcher created a 
Headquarters Office of Safety, Reliability, and Quality As-
surance, which was given responsibility for all agency-wide 
safety-related policy functions. In the process, the position of 
Chief Engineer was abolished.4 The new officeʼs Associate 
Administrator promptly initiated studies on Shuttle in-flight 
anomalies, overtime levels, the lack of spare parts, and land-
ing and crew safety systems, among other issues.5 Yet NASAʼs 
response to the Rogers Commission recommendation did not 
meet the Commissionʼs intent: the Associate Administrator 
did not have direct authority, and safety, reliability, and mis-
sion assurance activities across the agency remained depen-
dent on other programs and Centers for funding. 

General Accounting Office Review – 1990

A  1990  review  by  the  U.S.  General  Accounting  Office 
questioned the effectiveness of NASAʼs new safety organi-

zations in a report titled “Space Program Safety: Funding 
for NASAʼs Safety Organizations Should Be Centralized.”6 
The report concluded “NASA did not have an independent 
and  effective  safety  organization”  [emphasis  added].  Al-
though  the  safety  organizational  structure  may  have  “ap-
peared adequate,” in the late 1980s the space agency had 
concentrated most of its efforts on creating an independent 
safety office at NASA Headquarters. In contrast, the safety 
offices at NASAʼs field centers “were not entirely indepen-
dent because they obtained most of their funds from activi-
ties whose safety-related performance they were responsible 
for  overseeing.”  The  General  Accounting  Office  worried 
that “the lack of centralized independent funding may also 
restrict  the  flexibility  of  center  safety  managers.”  It  also 
suggested “most NASA safety managers believe that cen-
tralized SRM&QA [Safety, Reliability, Maintainability and 
Quality Assurance]  funding  would  ensure  independence.” 
NASA did not institute centralized funding in response to 
the General Accounting Office report, nor has it since. The 
problems outlined in 1990 persist to this day.

Space Flight Operations Contract – 1996

The  Space  Flight  Operations  Contract  was  intended  to 
streamline and modernize NASAʼs cumbersome contracting 
practices, thereby freeing the agency to focus on research 
and  development  (see  Chapter  5). Yet  its  implementation 
complicated issues of safety independence. A single contrac-
tor would, in principle, provide “oversight” on production, 
safety, and mission assurance, as well as cost management, 
while  NASA  maintained  “insight”  into  safety  and  quality 
assurance through reviews and metrics. Indeed, the reduc-
tion to a single primary contract simplified some aspects of 
the  NASA/contractor  interface.  However,  as  a  result,  ex-
perienced engineers changed jobs, NASA grew dependent 
on  contractors  for  technical  support,  contract  monitoring 
requirements  increased,  and  positions  were  subsequently 
staffed by less experienced engineers who were placed in 
management roles. 

Collectively,  this  eroded  NASAʼs  in-house  engineering 
and technical capabilities and increased the agencyʼs reli-
ance on the United Space Alliance and its subcontractors 
to identify, track, and resolve problems. The contract also 
involved substantial transfers of safety responsibility from 
the government to the private sector; rollbacks of tens of 
thousands  of  Government  Mandated  Inspection  Points; 
and  vast  reductions  in  NASAʼs  in-house  safety-related 
technical expertise (see Chapter 10). In the aggregate, these 
mid-1990s transformations rendered NASAʼs already prob-
lematic  safety  system  simultaneously  weaker  and  more 
complex. 

The effects of transitioning Shuttle operations to the Space 
Flight Operations Contract were not immediately apparent 
in the years following implementation. In November 1996, 
as  the  contract  was  being  implemented,  the  Aerospace 
Safety Advisory Panel published a comprehensive contract 
review, which concluded that the effort “to streamline the 
Space Shuttle program has not inadvertently created unac-
ceptable flight or ground risks.”7 The Aerospace Safety Ad-
visory Panelʼs passing grades proved temporary. 

Shuttle Independent Assessment Team – 1999

Just three years later, after a number of close calls, NASA 
chartered  the  Shuttle  Independent  Assessment  Team  to 
examine  Shuttle  sub-systems  and  maintenance  practices 
(see Chapter 5). The Shuttle Independent Assessment Team 
Report sounded a stern warning about the quality of NASAʼs 
Safety  and  Mission  Assurance  efforts  and  noted  that  the 
Space Shuttle Program had undergone a massive change in 
structure and was transitioning to “a slimmed down, con-
tractor-run operation.” 

The team produced several pointed conclusions: the Shuttle 
Program  was  inappropriately  using  previous  success  as 
a  justification  for  accepting  increased  risk;  the  Shuttle 
Programʼs ability to manage risk was being eroded “by the 
desire to reduce costs;” the size and complexity of the Shut-
tle Program and NASA/contractor relationships demanded 
better communication practices; NASAʼs safety and mission 
assurance organization was not sufficiently independent; and 
“the  workforce  has  received  a  conflicting  message  due  to 
the emphasis on achieving cost and staff reductions, and the 
pressures placed on increasing scheduled flights as a result 
of the Space Station” [emphasis added].8 The Shuttle Inde-
pendent Assessment Team found failures of communication 
to flow up from the “shop floor” and down from supervisors 
to  workers,  deficiencies  in  problem  and  waiver-tracking 
systems, potential conflicts of interest between Program and 
contractor goals, and a general failure to communicate re-
quirements and changes across organizations. In general, the 
Programʼs organizational culture was deemed “too insular.”9

NASA subsequently formed an Integrated Action Team to 
develop a plan to address the recommendations from pre-
vious  Program-specific  assessments,  including  the  Shuttle 
Independent Assessment Team, and to formulate improve-
ments.10 In part this effort was also a response to program 
missteps in the drive for efficiency seen in the “faster, better, 
cheaper” NASA of the 1990s. The NASA Integrated Action 
Team observed: “NASA should continue to remove commu-
nication barriers and foster an inclusive environment where 
open communication is the norm.” The intent was to estab-
lish an initiative where “the importance of communication 
and a culture of trust and openness permeate all facets of the 
organization.” The report indicated that “multiple processes 
to  get  the  messages  across  the  organizational  structure” 
would need to be explored and fostered [emphasis added]. 
The report recommended that NASA solicit expert advice in 
identifying and removing barriers, providing tools, training, 
and education, and facilitating communication processes. 

The Shuttle Independent Assessment Team and NASA Inte-
grated Action Team findings mirror those presented by the 
Rogers  Commission.  The  same  communication  problems 
persisted  in  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  at  the  time  of  the 
Columbia accident.

Space Shuttle Competitive Source 
Task Force – 2002

In  2002,  a  14-member  Space  Shuttle  Competitive  Task 
Force supported by the RAND Corporation examined com-

petitive sourcing options for the Shuttle Program. In its final 
report to NASA, the team highlighted several safety-related 
concerns, which the Board shares: 

Boardʼs deliberation. Fundamental to each theory is the im-
portance of strong organizational culture and commitment to  
building successful safety strategies.

•  Flight and ground hardware and software are obsolete, 
and  safety  upgrades  and  aging  infrastructure  repairs 
have been deferred. 

•  Budget  constraints  have  impacted  personnel  and  re-

sources required for maintenance and upgrades.

•  International Space Station schedules exert significant 

pressures on the Shuttle Program.

•  Certain mechanisms may impede worker anonymity in 

reporting safety concerns.

•  NASA does not have a truly independent safety function 
with the authority to halt the progress of a critical mis-
sion element. 11

Based on these findings, the task force suggested that an In-
dependent Safety Assurance function should be created that 
would hold one of “three keys” in the Certification of Flight 
Readiness  process  (NASA  and  the  operating  contractor 
would hold the other two), effectively giving this function 
the ability to stop any launch. Although in the Boardʼs view 
the “third key” Certification of Flight Readiness process is 
not a perfect solution, independent safety and verification 
functions  are  vital  to  continued  Shuttle  operations.  This 
independent  function  should  possess  the  authority  to  shut 
down  the  flight  preparation  processes  or  intervene  post-
launch when an anomaly occurs. 
 
7.2   ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSES: INSIGHTS FROM 

THEORY 

To develop a thorough understanding of accident causes and 
risk, and to better interpret the chain of events that led to the 
Columbia accident, the Board turned to the contemporary 
social  science  literature  on  accidents  and  risk  and  sought 
insight from experts in High Reliability, Normal Accident, 
and Organizational Theory.12 Additionally, the Board held a 
forum, organized by the National Safety Council, to define 
the essential characteristics of a sound safety program.13 

High Reliability Theory argues that organizations operating 
high-risk technologies, if properly designed and managed, 
can  compensate  for  inevitable  human  shortcomings,  and 
therefore  avoid  mistakes  that  under  other  circumstances 
would  lead  to  catastrophic  failures.14  Normal  Accident 
Theory, on the other hand, has a more pessimistic view of 
the  ability  of  organizations  and  their  members  to  manage 
high-risk  technology.  Normal Accident  Theory  holds  that 
organizational  and  technological  complexity  contributes 
to failures. Organizations that aspire to failure-free perfor-
mance are inevitably doomed to fail because of the inherent 
risks  in  the  technology  they  operate.15  Normal  Accident 
models  also  emphasize  systems  approaches  and  systems 
thinking, while the High Reliability model works from the 
bottom  up:  if  each  component  is  highly  reliable,  then  the 
system will be highly reliable and safe. 

Though  neither  High  Reliability  Theory  nor  Normal  Ac-
cident  Theory  is  entirely  appropriate  for  understanding 
this accident, insights from each figured prominently in the 

The  Board  selected  certain  well-known  traits  from  these 
models  to  use  as  a  yardstick  to  assess  the  Space  Shuttle 
Program, and found them particularly useful in shaping its 
views on whether NASAʼs current organization of its Hu-
man Space Flight Program is appropriate for the remaining 
years of Shuttle operation and beyond. Additionally, organi-
zational theory, which encompasses organizational culture, 
structure,  history,  and  hierarchy,  is  used  to  explain  the 
Columbia accident, and, ultimately, combines with Chapters 
5 and 6 to produce an expanded explanation of the accidentʼs 
causes.16 The  Board  believes  the  following  considerations 
are critical to understand what went wrong during STS-107. 
They will become the central motifs of the Boardʼs analysis 
later in this chapter.

•  Commitment to a Safety Culture: NASAʼs safety cul-
ture has become reactive, complacent, and dominated 
by unjustified optimism. Over time, slowly and unin-
tentionally, independent checks and balances intended 
to increase safety have been eroded in favor of detailed 
processes  that  produce  massive  amounts  of  data  and 
unwarranted consensus, but little effective communica-
tion. Organizations that successfully deal with high-risk 
technologies create and sustain a disciplined safety sys-
tem capable of identifying, analyzing, and controlling 
hazards throughout a technologyʼs life cycle.

•  Ability to Operate in Both a Centralized and Decen-
tralized Manner: The ability to operate in a centralized 
manner when appropriate, and to operate in a decentral-
ized  manner  when  appropriate,  is  the  hallmark  of  a 
high-reliability  organization.  On  the  operational  side, 
the  Space  Shuttle  Program  has  a  highly  centralized 
structure. Launch commit criteria and flight rules gov-
ern every imaginable contingency. The Mission Control 
Center and the Mission Management Team have very 
capable decentralized processes to solve problems that 
are not covered by such rules. The process is so highly 
regarded that it is considered one of the best problem-
solving organizations of its type.17 In these situations, 
mature processes anchor rules, procedures, and routines 
to  make  the  Shuttle  Programʼs  matrixed  workforce 
seamless, at least on the surface. 

  Nevertheless, it is evident that the position one occupies 
in this structure makes a difference. When supporting 
organizations  try  to  “push  back”  against  centralized 
Program direction – like the Debris Assessment Team 
did  during  STS-107  –  independent  analysis  gener-
ated  by  a  decentralized  decision-making  process  can 
be stifled. The Debris Assessment Team, working in an 
essentially decentralized format, was well-led and had 
the right expertise to work the problem, but their charter 
was “fuzzy,” and the team had little direct connection 
to the Mission Management Team. This lack of connec-
tion to the Mission Management Team and the Mission 
Evaluation Room is the single most compelling reason 
why  communications  were  so  poor  during  the  debris

assessment. In this case, the Shuttle Program was un-
able to simultaneously manage both the centralized and 
decentralized systems. 

•  Importance  of  Communication:  At  every  juncture 
of  STS-107,  the  Shuttle  Programʼs  structure  and  pro-
cesses, and therefore the managers in charge, resisted 
new information. Early in the mission, it became clear 
that the Program was not going to authorize imaging of 
the Orbiter because, in the Programʼs opinion, images 
were not needed. Overwhelming evidence indicates that 
Program leaders decided the foam strike was merely a 
maintenance problem long before any analysis had be-
gun. Every manager knew the party line: “weʼll wait for 
the analysis – no safety-of-flight issue expected.” Pro-
gram leaders spent at least as much time making sure 
hierarchical rules and processes were followed as they 
did trying to establish why anyone would want a picture 
of the Orbiter. These attitudes are incompatible with an 
organization that deals with high-risk technology.

•  Avoiding Oversimplification: The Columbia accident 
is  an  unfortunate  illustration  of  how  NASAʼs  strong 
cultural  bias  and  its  optimistic  organizational  think-
ing  undermined  effective  decision-making.  Over  the 
course of 22 years, foam strikes were normalized to the 
point where they were simply a “maintenance” issue 
– a concern that did not threaten a missionʼs success. 
This  oversimplification  of  the  threat  posed  by  foam 
debris  rendered  the  issue  a  low-level  concern  in  the 
minds of Shuttle managers. Ascent risk, so evident in 
Challenger, biased leaders to focus on strong signals 
from  the  Shuttle  System  Main  Engine  and  the  Solid 
Rocket  Boosters.  Foam  strikes,  by  comparison,  were 
a weak and consequently overlooked signal, although 
they turned out to be no less dangerous. 

•  Conditioned by Success: Even after it was clear from 
the launch videos that foam had struck the Orbiter in a 
manner never before seen, Space Shuttle Program man-
agers were not unduly alarmed. They could not imagine 
why  anyone  would  want  a  photo  of  something  that 
could be fixed after landing. More importantly, learned 
attitudes about foam strikes diminished managementʼs 
wariness  of  their  danger. The  Shuttle  Program  turned 
“the  experience  of  failure  into  the  memory  of  suc-
cess.”18  Managers  also  failed  to  develop  simple  con-
tingency  plans  for  a  re-entry  emergency.  They  were 
convinced,  without  study,  that  nothing  could  be  done 
about such an emergency. The intellectual curiosity and 
skepticism that a solid safety culture requires was al-
most entirely absent. Shuttle managers did not embrace 
safety-conscious attitudes. Instead, their attitudes were 
shaped and reinforced by an organization that, in this in-
stance, was incapable of stepping back and gauging its 
biases. Bureaucracy and process trumped thoroughness 
and reason. 

•  Significance of Redundancy: The Human Space Flight 
Program has compromised the many redundant process-
es, checks, and balances that should identify and correct 
small  errors.  Redundant  systems  essential  to  every 

high-risk enterprise have fallen victim to bureaucratic 
efficiency. Years of workforce reductions and outsourc-
ing have culled from NASAʼs workforce the layers of 
experience and hands-on systems knowledge that once 
provided  a  capacity  for  safety  oversight.  Safety  and 
Mission Assurance personnel have been eliminated, ca-
reers in safety have lost organizational prestige, and the 
Program now decides on its own how much safety and 
engineering oversight it needs. Aiming to align its in-
spection regime with the International Organization for 
Standardization 9000/9001 protocol, commonly used in 
industrial environments – environments very different 
than  the  Shuttle  Program  –  the  Human  Space  Flight 
Program  shifted  from  a  comprehensive  “oversight” 
inspection process to a more limited “insight” process, 
cutting mandatory inspection points by more than half 
and leaving even fewer workers to make “second” or 
“third” Shuttle systems checks (see Chapter 10). 

Implications for the Shuttle Program Organization

The  Boardʼs  investigation  into  the  Columbia  accident  re-
vealed two major causes with which NASA has to contend: 
one technical, the other organizational. As mentioned earlier, 
the Board studied the two dominant theories on complex or-
ganizations and accidents involving high-risk technologies. 
These  schools  of  thought  were  influential  in  shaping  the 
Boardʼs organizational recommendations, primarily because 
each takes a different approach to understanding accidents 
and risk. 

The  Board  determined  that  high-reliability  theory  is  ex-
tremely useful in describing the culture that should exist in 
the human space flight organization. NASA and the Space 
Shuttle  Program  must  be  committed  to  a  strong  safety 
culture,  a  view  that  serious  accidents  can  be  prevented,  a 
willingness  to  learn  from  mistakes,  from  technology,  and 
from others, and a realistic training program that empowers 
employees to know when to decentralize or centralize prob-
lem-solving. The Shuttle Program cannot afford the mindset 
that accidents are inevitable because it may lead to unneces-
sarily accepting known and preventable risks.

The Board believes normal accident theory has a key role 
in human spaceflight as well. Complex organizations need 
specific mechanisms to maintain their commitment to safety 
and assist their understanding of how complex interactions 
can make organizations accident-prone. Organizations can-
not put blind faith into redundant warning systems because 
they inherently create more complexity, and this complexity 
in turn often produces unintended system interactions that 
can lead to failure. The Human Space Flight Program must 
realize that additional protective layers are not always the 
best choice. The Program must also remain sensitive to the 
fact  that  despite  its  best  intentions,  managers,  engineers, 
safety professionals, and other employees, can, when con-
fronted with extraordinary demands, act in counterproduc-
tive ways.

The challenges to failure-free performance highlighted by 
these two theoretical approaches will always be present in 
an organization that aims to send humans into space. What

can the Program do about these difficulties? The Board con-
sidered three alternatives. First, the Board could recommend 
that NASA follow traditional paths to improving safety by 
making changes to policy, procedures, and processes. These 
initiatives could improve organizational culture. The analy-
sis provided by experts and the literature leads the Board 
to conclude that although reforming management practices 
has certain merits, it also has critical limitations. Second, the 
Board could recommend that the Shuttle is simply too risky 
and  should  be  grounded. As  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter 
9, the Board is committed to continuing human space ex-
ploration, and believes the Shuttle Program can and should 
continue to operate. Finally, the Board could recommend a 
significant change to the organizational structure that con-
trols  the  Space  Shuttle  Programʼs  technology. As  will  be 
discussed at length in this chapterʼs conclusion, the Board 
believes this option has the best chance to successfully man-
age the complexities and risks of human space flight.
7.3   ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSES: EVALUATING BEST 

SAFETY PRACTICES

Many of the principles of solid safety practice identified as 
crucial  by  independent  reviews  of  NASA  and  in  accident 
and risk literature are exhibited by organizations that, like 
NASA, operate risky technologies with little or no margin 
for  error.  While  the  Board  appreciates  that  organizations 
dealing with high-risk technology cannot sustain accident-
free performance indefinitely, evidence suggests that there 
are effective ways to minimize risk and limit the number of 
accidents. 

In this section, the Board compares NASA to three specific 
examples of independent safety programs that have strived 
for  accident-free  performance  and  have,  by  and  large, 
achieved it: the U.S. Navy Submarine Flooding Prevention 
and Recovery (SUBSAFE), Naval Nuclear Propulsion (Na-
val  Reactors)  programs,  and  the Aerospace  Corporationʼs 
Launch Verification Process, which supports U.S. Air Force 
space  launches.19  The  safety  cultures  and  organizational 
structure  of  all  three  make  them  highly  adept  in  dealing 
with inordinately high risk by designing hardware and man-
agement  systems  that  prevent  seemingly  inconsequential 
failures  from  leading  to  major  accidents.  Although  size, 
complexity, and missions in these organizations and NASA 
differ, the following comparisons yield valuable lessons for 
the space agency to consider when re-designing its organiza-
tion to increase safety.

Navy Submarine and Reactor Safety Programs 

Human space flight and submarine programs share notable 
similarities. Spacecraft and submarines both operate in haz-
ardous environments, use complex and dangerous systems, 
and perform missions of critical national significance. Both 
NASA and Navy operational experience include failures (for 
example,  USS  Thresher,  USS  Scorpion,  Apollo  1  capsule 
fire, Challenger, and Columbia). Prior to the Columbia mis-
hap, Administrator Sean OʼKeefe initiated the NASA/Navy 
Benchmarking Exchange to compare and contrast the pro-
grams, specifically in safety and mission assurance.20 

The Navy SUBSAFE and Naval Reactor programs exercise 
a  high  degree  of  engineering  discipline,  emphasize  total 
responsibility of individuals and organizations, and provide 
redundant  and  rapid  means  of  communicating  problems 
to  decision-makers.  The  Navyʼs  nuclear  safety  program 
emerged with its first nuclear-powered warship (USS Nau-
tilus), while non-nuclear SUBSAFE practices evolved from 
from past flooding mishaps and philosophies first introduced 
by  Naval  Reactors.  The  Navy  lost  two  nuclear-powered 
submarines in the 1960s – the USS Thresher in 1963 and 
the Scorpion 1968 – which resulted in a renewed effort to 
prevent accidents.21 The SUBSAFE program was initiated 
just two months after the Thresher mishap to identify criti-
cal changes to submarine certification requirements. Until a 
ship was independently recertified, its operating depth and 
maneuvers were limited. SUBSAFE proved its value as a 
means of verifying the readiness and safety of submarines, 
and continues to do so today.22

The  Naval  Reactor  Program  is  a  joint  Navy/Department 
of Energy organization responsible for all aspects of Navy 
nuclear propulsion, including research, design, construction, 
testing,  training,  operation,  maintenance,  and  the  disposi-
tion of the nuclear propulsion plants onboard many Naval 
ships and submarines, as well as their radioactive materials. 
Although the naval fleet is ultimately responsible for day-
to-day operations and maintenance, those operations occur 
within  parameters  established  by  an  entirely  independent 
division of Naval Reactors. 

The U.S. nuclear Navy has more than 5,500 reactor years of 
experience without a reactor accident. Put another way, nu-
clear-powered warships have steamed a cumulative total of 
over 127 million miles, which is roughly equivalent to over 
265 lunar roundtrips. In contrast, the Space Shuttle Program 
has spent about three years on-orbit, although its spacecraft 
have traveled some 420 million miles.

Naval Reactor success depends on several key elements: 

•  Concise and timely communication of problems using 

redundant paths 

•  Insistence on airing minority opinions 
•  Formal  written  reports  based  on  independent  peer-re-

viewed recommendations from prime contractors 

•  Facing facts objectively and with attention to detail 
•  Ability to manage change and deal with obsolescence of 

classes of warships over their lifetime 

These elements can be grouped into several thematic cat-
egories:

•  Communication  and  Action:  Formal  and  informal 
practices ensure that relevant personnel at all levels are 
informed of technical decisions and actions that affect 
their area of responsibility. Contractor technical recom-
mendations and government actions are documented in 
peer-reviewed  formal  written  correspondence.  Unlike 
NASA, PowerPoint briefings and papers for technical 
seminars are not substitutes for completed staff work. In 
addition, contractors strive to provide recommendations 

1 8 2

based on a technical need, uninfluenced by headquarters 
or its representatives. Accordingly, division of respon-
sibilities  between  the  contractor  and  the  Government 
remain clear, and a system of checks and balances is 
therefore inherent.

 
•  Recurring Training  and  Learning  From  Mistakes: 
The  Naval  Reactor  Program  has  yet  to  experience  a 
reactor  accident. This  success  is  partially  a  testament 
to  design,  but  also  due  to  relentless  and  innovative 
training, grounded on lessons learned both inside and 
outside the program. For example, since 1996, Naval 
Reactors has educated more than 5,000 Naval Nuclear 
Propulsion  Program  personnel  on  the  lessons  learned 
from  the  Challenger  accident.23  Senior  NASA  man-
agers  recently  attended  the  143rd  presentation  of  the 
Naval Reactors seminar entitled “The Challenger Ac-
cident Re-examined.” The Board credits NASAʼs inter-
est in the Navy nuclear community, and encourages the 
agency to continue to learn from the mistakes of other 
organizations as well as from its own. 

•  Encouraging Minority Opinions: The Naval Reactor 
Program encourages minority opinions and “bad news.” 
Leaders continually emphasize that when no minority 
opinions are present, the responsibility for a thorough 
and critical examination falls to management. Alternate 
perspectives and critical questions are always encour-
aged.  In  practice,  NASA  does  not  appear  to  embrace 
these attitudes. Board interviews revealed that it is diffi-
cult for minority and dissenting opinions to percolate up 
through the agencyʼs hierarchy, despite processes like 
the  anonymous  NASA  Safety  Reporting  System  that 
supposedly encourages the airing of opinions.

•  Retaining  Knowledge:  Naval  Reactors  uses  many 
mechanisms to ensure knowledge is retained. The Di-
rector serves a minimum eight-year term, and the pro-
gram documents the history of the rationale for every 
technical requirement. Key personnel in Headquarters 
routinely rotate into field positions to remain familiar 
with every aspect of operations, training, maintenance, 
development  and  the  workforce.  Current  and  past  is-
sues are discussed in open forum with the Director and 
immediate staff at “all-hands” informational meetings 
under an in-house professional development program. 
NASA lacks such a program.

•  Worst-Case  Event  Failures:  Naval  Reactors  hazard 
analyses evaluate potential damage to the reactor plant, 
potential impact on people, and potential environmental 
impact.  The  Board  identified  NASAʼs  failure  to  ad-
equately prepare for a range of worst-case scenarios as 
a weakness in the agencyʼs safety and mission assurance 
training programs. 

SUBSAFE 

The Board observed the following during its study of the 
Navyʼs SUBSAFE Program.

•  SUBSAFE  requirements  are  clearly  documented  and 
achievable,  with  minimal  “tailoring”  or  granting  of 
waivers.  NASA  requirements  are  clearly  documented 
but are also more easily waived.

•  A  separate  compliance  verification  organization  inde-
pendently  assesses  program  management.24  NASAʼs 
Flight Preparation Process, which leads to Certification 
of Flight Readiness, is supposed to be an independent 
check-and-balance  process.  However, 
the  Shuttle 
Programʼs control of both engineering and safety com-
promises  the  independence  of  the  Flight  Preparation 
Process. 

•  The submarine Navy has a strong safety culture that em-
phasizes understanding and learning from past failures. 
NASA emphasizes safety as well, but training programs 
are not robust and methods of learning from past fail-
ures are informal.

•  The Navy implements extensive safety training based 
on the Thresher and Scorpion accidents. NASA has not 
focused on any of its past accidents as a means of men-
toring new engineers or those destined for management 
positions. 

•  The  SUBSAFE  structure  is  enhanced  by  the  clarity, 
uniformity,  and  consistency  of  submarine  safety  re-
quirements and responsibilities. Program managers are 
not permitted to “tailor” requirements without approval 
from the organization with final authority for technical 
requirements  and  the  organization  that  verifies  SUB-
SAFEʼs  compliance  with  critical  design  and  process 
requirements.25

•  The  SUBSAFE  Program  and  implementing  organiza-
tion are relatively immune to budget pressures. NASAʼs 
program structure requires the Program Manager posi-
tion to consider such issues, which forces the manager 
to juggle cost, schedule, and safety considerations. In-
dependent advice on these issues is therefore inevitably 
subject to political and administrative pressure.

•  Compliance  with  critical  SUBSAFE  design  and  pro-
cess requirements is independently verified by a highly 
capable  centralized  organization  that  also  “owns”  the 
processes and monitors the program for compliance.

•  Quantitative safety assessments in the Navy submarine 
program  are  deterministic  rather  than  probabilistic. 
NASA does not have a quantitative, program-wide risk 
and safety database to support future design capabilities 
and assist risk assessment teams.

Comparing Navy Programs with NASA 

Significant differences exist between NASA and Navy sub-
marine programs.

•  Requirements  Ownership  (Technical  Authority): 
Both the SUBSAFE and Naval Reactorsʼ organizational

approach separates the technical and funding authority 
from program management in safety matters. The Board 
believes this separation of authority of program man-
agers – who, by nature, must be sensitive to costs and 
schedules – and “owners” of technical requirements and 
waiver capabilities – who, by nature, are more sensitive 
to safety and technical rigor – is crucial. In the Naval 
Reactors Program, safety matters are the responsibility 
of the technical authority. They are not merely relegated 
to  an  independent  safety  organization  with  oversight 
responsibilities. This creates valuable checks and bal-
ances for safety matters in the Naval Reactors Program 
technical “requirements owner” community.

•  Emphasis  on  Lessons  Learned:  Both  Naval  Reac-
tors  and  the  SUBSAFE  have  “institutionalized” their 
“lessons  learned”  approaches  to  ensure  that  knowl-
edge  gained  from  both  good  and  bad  experience 
is  maintained  in  corporate  memory.  This  has  been 
accomplished  by  designating  a  central  technical  au-
thority  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining 
functional technical requirements as well as providing 
an organizational and institutional focus for capturing, 
documenting, and using operational lessons to improve 
future  designs.  NASA  has  an  impressive  history  of 
scientific discovery, but can learn much from the ap-
plication of lessons learned, especially those that relate 
to  future  vehicle  design  and  training  for  contingen-
cies. NASA has a broad Lessons Learned Information 
System  that  is  strictly  voluntary  for  program/project 
managers and management teams. Ideally, the Lessons 
Learned  Information  System  should  support  overall 
program  management  and  engineering  functions  and 
provide a historical experience base to aid conceptual 
developments and preliminary design. 

The Aerospace Corporation

The Aerospace Corporation, created in 1960, operates as a 
Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Center  that 
supports the government in science and technology that is 
critical to national security. It is the equivalent of a $500 
million  enterprise  that  supports  U.S.  Air  Force  planning, 
development,  and  acquisition  of  space  launch  systems. 
The Aerospace  Corporation  employs  approximately  3,200 
people including 2,200 technical staff (29 percent Doctors 
of Philosophy, 41 percent Masters of Science) who conduct 
advanced  planning,  system  design  and  integration,  verify 
readiness, and provide technical oversight of contractors.26 

The Aerospace Corporationʼs independent launch verifica-
tion process offers another relevant benchmark for NASAʼs 
safety  and  mission  assurance  program.  Several  aspects  of 
the Aerospace Corporation launch verification process and 
independent mission assurance structure could be tailored to 
the Shuttle Program. 

Aerospaceʼs primary product is a formal verification letter 
to the Air Force Systems Program Office stating a vehicle 
has  been  independently  verified  as  ready  for  launch.  The 
verification includes an independent General Systems En-
gineering and Integration review of launch preparations by 

Aerospace staff, a review of launch system design and pay-
load integration, and a review of the adequacy of flight and 
ground hardware, software, and interfaces. This “concept-
to-orbit” process begins in the design requirements phase, 
continues  through  the  formal  verification  to  countdown 
and launch, and concludes with a post-flight evaluation of 
events  with  findings  for  subsequent  missions.  Aerospace 
Corporation personnel cover the depth and breadth of space 
disciplines, and the organization has its own integrated en-
gineering  analysis,  laboratory,  and  test  matrix  capability. 
This enables the Aerospace Corporation to rapidly transfer 
lessons  learned  and  respond  to  program  anomalies.  Most 
importantly, Aerospace is uniquely independent and is not 
subject to any schedule or cost pressures.

The Aerospace Corporation and the Air Force have found 
the  independent  launch  verification  process  extremely 
valuable. Aerospace Corporation involvement in Air Force 
launch verification has significantly reduced engineering er-
rors, resulting in a 2.9 percent “probability-of-failure” rate 
for expendable launch vehicles, compared to 14.6 percent in 
the commercial sector.27 

Conclusion

The practices noted here suggest that responsibility and au-
thority for decisions involving technical requirements and 
safety should rest with an independent technical authority. 
Organizations that successfully operate high-risk technolo-
gies  have  a  major  characteristic  in  common:  they  place  a 
premium on safety and reliability by structuring their pro-
grams so that technical and safety engineering organizations 
own the process of determining, maintaining, and waiving 
technical requirements with a voice that is equal to yet in-
dependent of Program Managers, who are governed by cost, 
schedule  and  mission-accomplishment  goals.  The  Naval 
Reactors Program, SUBSAFE program, and the Aerospace 
Corporation  are  examples  of  organizations  that  have  in-
vested  in  redundant  technical  authorities  and  processes  to 
become highly reliable.
7.4   ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSES: 
A BROKEN SAFETY CULTURE 
 

Perhaps  the  most  perplexing  question  the  Board  faced 
during  its  seven-month  investigation  into  the  Columbia 
accident  was  “How  could  NASA  have  missed  the  signals 
the  foam  was  sending?”  Answering  this  question  was  a 
challenge.  The  investigation  revealed  that  in  most  cases, 
the Human Space Flight Program is extremely aggressive in 
reducing threats to safety. But we also know – in hindsight 
– that detection of the dangers posed by foam was impeded 
by “blind spots” in NASAʼs safety culture. 

From the beginning, the Board witnessed a consistent lack 
of concern about the debris strike on Columbia. NASA man-
agers  told  the  Board  “there  was  no  safety-of-flight  issue” 
and “we couldnʼt have done anything about it anyway.” The 
investigation uncovered a troubling pattern in which Shuttle 
Program  management  made  erroneous  assumptions  about 
the robustness of a system based on prior success rather than 
on dependable engineering data and rigorous testing.

The  Shuttle  Programʼs  complex  structure  erected  barriers 
to effective communication and its safety culture no longer 
asks enough hard questions about risk. (Safety culture refers 
to an organizationʼs characteristics and attitudes – promoted 
by its leaders and internalized by its members – that serve 
to make safety the top priority.) In this context, the Board 
believes the mistakes that were made on STS-107 are not 
isolated  failures,  but  are  indicative  of  systemic  flaws  that 
existed prior to the accident. Had the Shuttle Program ob-
served the principles discussed in the previous two sections, 
the threat that foam posed to the Orbiter, particularly after 
the  STS-112  and  STS-107  foam  strikes,  might  have  been 
more fully appreciated by Shuttle Program management. 

In  this  section,  the  Board  examines  the  NASAʼs  safety 
policy, structure, and process, communication barriers, the 
risk  assessment  systems  that  govern  decision-making  and 
risk management, and the Shuttle Programʼs penchant for 
substituting analysis for testing. 

NASAʼs Safety: Policy, Structure, and Process

quarters and decentralized execution of safety programs at 
the  enterprise,  program,  and  project  levels.  Headquarters 
dictates what must be done, not how it should be done. The 
operational premise that logically follows is that safety is the 
responsibility of program and project managers. Managers 
are subsequently given flexibility to organize safety efforts 
as they see fit, while NASA Headquarters is charged with 
maintaining oversight through independent surveillance and 
assessment.28  NASA  policy  dictates  that  safety  programs 
should be placed high enough in the organization, and be 
vested  with  enough  authority  and  seniority,  to  “maintain 
independence.”  Signals  of  potential  danger,  anomalies, 
and critical information should, in principle, surface in the 
hazard identification process and be tracked with risk assess-
ments supported by engineering analyses. In reality, such a 
process demands a more independent status than NASA has 
ever been willing to give its safety organizations, despite the 
recommendations of numerous outside experts over nearly 
two  decades,  including  the  Rogers  Commission  (1986), 
General Accounting Office (1990), and the Shuttle Indepen-
dent Assessment Team (2000).

Marshall  Safety  and  Mission Assurance  organizations  are 
organized similarly. In contrast, Kennedy has decentralized 
its Safety and Mission Assurance components and assigned 
them  to  the  Shuttle  Processing  Directorate. This  manage-
ment change renders Kennedyʼs Safety and Mission Assur-
ance structure even more dependent on the Shuttle Program, 
which reduces effective oversight. 

At Johnson, safety programs are centralized under a Direc-
tor who oversees five divisions and an Independent Assess-
ment  Office.  Each  division  has  clearly-defined  roles  and 
responsibilities,  with  the  exception  of  the  Space  Shuttle 
Division Chief, whose job description does not reflect the 
full scope of authority and responsibility ostensibly vested 
in the position. Yet the Space Shuttle Division Chief is em-
powered to represent the Center, the Shuttle Program, and 
NASA Headquarters Safety and Mission Assurance at criti-
cal  junctures  in  the  safety  process. The  position  therefore 
represents a critical node in NASAʼs Safety and Mission As-
surance architecture that seems to the Board to be plagued 
by conflict of interest. It is a single point of failure without 
any checks or balances. 

Johnson  also  has  a  Shuttle  Program  Safety  and  Mission 
Assurance Manager who oversees United Space Allianceʼs 
safety  organization.  The  Shuttle  Program  further  receives 
program safety support from the Centerʼs Safety, Reliability, 
and  Quality Assurance  Space  Shuttle  Division.  Johnsonʼs 
Space  Shuttle  Division  Chief  has  the  additional  role  of 
Shuttle Program Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance 
Manager (see Figure 7.4-1). Over the years, this dual desig-
nation has resulted in a general acceptance of the fact that 
the Johnson Space Shuttle Division Chief performs duties 
on  both  the  Centerʼs  and  Programʼs  behalf. The  detached 
nature of the support provided by the Space Shuttle Division 
Chief, and the wide band of the positionʼs responsibilities 
throughout multiple layers of NASAʼs hierarchy, confuses 
lines  of  authority,  responsibility,  and  accountability  in  a 
manner that almost defies explanation.

A  March  2001  NASA  Office  of  Inspector  General  Audit 
Report on Space Shuttle Program Management Safety Ob-
servations made the same point: 

The  job  descriptions  and  responsibilities  of  the  Space 
Shuttle  Program  Manager  and  Chief,  Johnson  Safety 
Office Space Shuttle Division, are nearly identical with 
each official reporting to a different manager. This over-
lap  in  responsibilities  conflicts  with  the  SFOC  [Space 
Flight  Operations  Contract]  and  NSTS  07700,  which 
requires the Chief, Johnson Safety Office Space Shuttle 
Division, to provide matrixed personnel support to the 
Space Shuttle Program Safety Manager in fulfilling re-
quirements applicable to the safety, reliability, and qual-
ity assurance aspects of the Space Shuttle Program.

The fact that Headquarters, Center, and Program functions 
are rolled-up into one position is an example of how a care-
fully designed oversight process has been circumvented and 
made susceptible to conflicts of interest. This organizational 
construct is unnecessarily bureaucratic and defeats NASAʼs 
stated  objective  of  providing  an  independent  safety  func-

tion. A similar argument can be made about the placement 
of quality assurance in the Shuttle Processing Divisions at 
Kennedy,  which  increases  the  risk  that  quality  assurance 
personnel will become too “familiar” with programs they are 
charged to oversee, which hinders oversight and judgment.

The Board believes that although the Space Shuttle Program 
has effective safety practices at the “shop floor” level, its 
operational  and  systems  safety  program  is  flawed  by  its 
dependence on the Shuttle Program. Hindered by a cumber-
some  organizational  structure,  chronic  understaffing,  and 
poor  management  principles,  the  safety  apparatus  is  not 
currently capable of fulfilling its mission. An independent 
safety structure would provide the Shuttle Program a more 
effective operational safety process. Crucial components of 
this structure include a comprehensive integration of safety 
across all the Shuttle programs and elements, and a more 
independent system of checks and balances. 

Safety Process

In response to the Rogers Commission Report, NASA es-
tablished  what  is  now  known  as  the  Office  of  Safety  and 
Mission Assurance at Headquarters to independently moni-
tor  safety  and  ensure  communication  and  accountability 
agency-wide. The Office of Safety and Mission Assurance 
monitors  unusual  events  like  “out  of  family”  anomalies 
and establishes agency-wide Safety and Mission Assurance 
policy.  (An  out-of-family  event  is  an  operation  or  perfor-
mance outside the expected performance range for a given 
parameter  or  which  has  not  previously  been  experienced.) 
The Office of Safety and Mission Assurance also screens the 
Shuttle  Programʼs  Flight  Readiness  Process  and  signs  the 
Certificate of Flight Readiness. The Shuttle Program Man-
ager, in turn, is responsible for overall Shuttle safety and is 
supported by a one-person safety staff.

The  Shuttle  Program  has  been  permitted  to  organize  its 
safety program as it sees fit, which has resulted in a lack of 
standardized structure throughout NASAʼs various Centers, 
enterprises, programs, and projects. The level of funding a 
program is granted impacts how much safety the Program 
can “buy” from a Centerʼs safety organization. In turn, Safe-
ty and Mission Assurance organizations struggle to antici-
pate program requirements and guarantee adequate support 
for the many programs for which they are responsible. 

It  is  the  Boardʼs  view,  shared  by  previous  assessments, 
that the current safety system structure leaves the Office of 
Safety and Mission Assurance ill-equipped to hold a strong 
and central role in integrating safety functions. NASA Head-
quarters has not effectively integrated safety efforts across 
its  culturally  and  technically  distinct  Centers.  In  addition, 
the practice of “buying” safety services establishes a rela-
tionship in which programs sustain the very livelihoods of 
the safety experts hired to oversee them. These idiosyncra-
sies of structure and funding preclude the safety organiza-
tion from effectively providing independent safety analysis. 

The commit-to-flight review process, as described in Chap-
ters 2 and 6, consists of program reviews and readiness polls 
that are structured to allow NASAʼs senior leaders to assess

mission readiness. In like fashion, safety organizations affil-
iated with various projects, programs, and Centers at NASA, 
conduct a Pre-launch Assessment Review of safety prepara-
tions and mission concerns. The Shuttle Program does not 
officially sanction the Pre-launch Assessment Review, which 
updates the Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission 
Assurance on safety concerns during the Flight Readiness 
Review/Certification of Flight Readiness process.

The Johnson Space Shuttle Safety, Reliability, and Quality 
Assurance Division Chief orchestrates this review on behalf 
of Headquarters. Note that this division chief also advises 
the  Shuttle  Program  Manager  of  Safety.  Because  it  lacks 
independent analytical rigor, the Pre-launch Assessment Re-
view is only marginally effective. In this arrangement, the 
Johnson Shuttle Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance 
Division Chief is expected to render an independent assess-
ment of his own activities. Therefore, the Board is concerned 
that the Pre-Launch Assessment Review is not an effective 
check and balance in the Flight Readiness Review. 

Given that the entire Safety and Mission Assurance orga-
nization depends on the Shuttle Program for resources and 
simultaneously  lacks  the  independent  ability  to  conduct 
detailed  analyses,  cost  and  schedule  pressures  can  easily 
and unintentionally influence safety deliberations. Structure 
and process places Shuttle safety programs in the unenvi-
able position of having to choose between rubber-stamping 
engineering analyses, technical efforts, and Shuttle program 
decisions,  or  trying  to  carry  the  day  during  a  committee 
meeting  in  which  the  other  side  almost  always  has  more 
information and analytic capability. 

NASA Barriers to Communication: Integration, 
Information Systems, and Databases

By their very nature, high-risk technologies are exception-
ally difficult to manage. Complex and intricate, they consist 
of numerous interrelated parts. Standing alone, components 
may  function  adequately,  and  failure  modes  may  be  an-
ticipated. Yet when components are integrated into a total 
system and work in concert, unanticipated interactions can 
occur  that  can  lead  to  catastrophic  outcomes.29  The  risks 
inherent  in  these  technical  systems  are  heightened  when 
they are produced and operated by complex organizations 
that can also break down in unanticipated ways. The Shuttle 
Program is such an organization. All of these factors make 
effective communication – between individuals and between 
programs – absolutely critical. However, the structure and 
complexity of the Shuttle Program hinders communication.

The Shuttle Program consists of government and contract 
personnel  who  cover  an  array  of  scientific  and  technical 
disciplines and are affiliated with various dispersed space, 
research, and test centers. NASA derives its organizational 
complexity  from  its  origins  as  much  as  its  widely  varied 
missions.  NASA  Centers  naturally  evolved  with  different 
points of focus, a “divergence” that the Rogers Commission 
found  evident  in  the  propensity  of  Marshall  personnel  to 
resolve problems without including program managers out-
side their Center – especially managers at Johnson, to whom 
they officially reported (see Chapter 5).

Despite periodic attempts to emphasize safety, NASAʼs fre-
quent reorganizations in the drive to become more efficient 
reduced the budget for safety, sending employees conflict-
ing  messages  and  creating  conditions  more  conducive  to 
the development of a conventional bureaucracy than to the 
maintenance  of  a  safety-conscious  research-and-develop-
ment organization. Over time, a pattern of ineffective com-
munication has resulted, leaving risks improperly defined, 
problems  unreported,  and  concerns  unexpressed.30  The 
question is, why?

The transition to the Space Flight Operations Contract – and 
the effects it initiated – provides part of the answer. In the 
Space  Flight  Operations  Contract,  NASA  encountered  a 
completely new set of structural constraints that hindered ef-
fective communication. New organizational and contractual 
requirements demanded an even more complex system of 
shared management reviews, reporting relationships, safety 
oversight  and  insight,  and  program  information  develop-
ment, dissemination, and tracking. 

The  Shuttle  Independent Assessment Teamʼs  report  docu-
mented these changes, noting that “the size and complexity 
of the Shuttle system and of the NASA/contractor relation-
ships place extreme importance on understanding, commu-
nication, and information handling.”31 Among other findings, 
the Shuttle Independent Assessment Team observed that:

•  The current Shuttle program culture is too insular
•  There  is  a  potential  for  conflicts  between  contractual 

and programmatic goals

systems

•  There are deficiencies in problem and waiver-tracking 

•  The exchange of communication across the Shuttle pro-
gram hierarchy is structurally limited, both upward and 
downward.32

The Board believes that deficiencies in communication, in-
cluding those spelled out by the Shuttle Independent Assess-
ment Team, were a foundation for the Columbia accident. 
These deficiencies are byproducts of a cumbersome, bureau-
cratic,  and  highly  complex  Shuttle  Program  structure  and 
the absence of authority in two key program areas that are 
responsible for integrating information across all programs 
and elements in the Shuttle program. 

Integration Structures

NASA did not adequately prepare for the consequences of 
adding  organizational  structure  and  process  complexity  in 
the transition to the Space Flight Operations Contract. The 
agencyʼs lack of a centralized clearinghouse for integration 
and safety further hindered safe operations. In the Boardʼs 
opinion,  the  Shuttle  Integration  and  Shuttle  Safety,  Reli-
ability, and Quality Assurance Offices do not fully integrate 
information on behalf of the Shuttle Program. This is due, in 
part, to an irregular division of responsibilities between the 
Integration Office and the Orbiter Vehicle Engineering Office 
and the absence of a truly independent safety organization.

Within the Shuttle Program, the Orbiter Office handles many 
key integration tasks, even though the Integration Office ap-

pears to be the more logical office to conduct them; the Or-
biter Office does not actively participate in the Integration 
Control  Board;  and  Orbiter  Office  managers  are  actually 
ranked above their Integration Office counterparts. These 
uncoordinated  roles  result  in  conflicting  and  erroneous 
information, and support the perception that the Orbiter Of-
fice is isolated from the Integration Office and has its own 
priorities.

The Shuttle Programʼs structure and process for Safety and 
Mission Assurance activities further confuse authority and 
responsibility  by  giving  the  Programʼs  Safety  and  Mis-
sion Assurance Manager technical oversight of the safety 
aspects  of  the  Space  Flight  Operations  Contract,  while 
simultaneously making the Johnson Space Shuttle Division 
Chief responsible for advising the Program on safety per-
formance. As a result, no one office or person in Program 
management  is  responsible  for  developing  an  integrated 
risk assessment above the sub-system level that would pro-
vide a comprehensive picture of total program risks. The 
net effect is that many Shuttle Program safety, quality, and 
mission assurance roles are never clearly defined.

Safety Information Systems 

Numerous  reviews  and  independent  assessments  have 
noted that NASAʼs safety system does not effectively man-
age risk. In particular, these reviews have observed that the 
processes in which NASA tracks and attempts to mitigate 
the risks posed by components on its Critical Items List is 
flawed.  The  Post  Challenger  Evaluation  of  Space  Shuttle 
Risk  Assessment  and  Management  Report  (1988)  con-
cluded that:

The  committee  views  NASA  critical  items  list  (CIL) 
waiver  decision-making  process  as  being  subjective, 
with little in the way of formal and consistent criteria 
for approval or rejection of waivers. Waiver decisions 
appear to be driven almost exclusively by the design 
based  Failure  Mode  Effects  Analysis  (FMEA)/CIL 
retention rationale, rather than being based on an in-
tegrated assessment of all inputs to risk management. 
The retention rationales appear biased toward proving 
that the design is “safe,” sometimes ignoring signifi-
cant evidence to the contrary. 

The report continues, “… the Committee has not found an 
independent,  detailed  analysis  or  assessment  of  the  CIL 
retention rationale which considers all inputs to the risk as-
sessment process.”33 Ten years later, the Shuttle Independent 
Assessment Team reported “Risk Management process ero-
sion created by the desire to reduce costs …” 34 The Shuttle 
Independent Assessment Team argued strongly that NASA 
Safety and Mission Assurance should be restored to its pre-
vious role of an independent oversight body, and Safety and 
Mission Assurance not be simply a “safety auditor.” 

The Board found similar problems with integrated hazard 
analyses  of  debris  strikes  on  the  Orbiter.  In  addition,  the 
information systems supporting the Shuttle – intended to be 
tools for decision-making – are extremely cumbersome and 
difficult to use at any level. 

The following addresses the hazard tracking tools and major 
databases in the Shuttle Program that promote risk manage-
ment.

•  Hazard Analysis: A  fundamental  element  of  system 
safety  is  managing  and  controlling  hazards.  NASAʼs 
only  guidance  on  hazard  analysis  is  outlined  in  the 
Methodology  for  Conduct  of  Space  Shuttle  Program 
Hazard Analysis,  which  merely  lists  tools  available.35 
Therefore, it is not surprising that hazard analysis pro-
cesses are applied inconsistently across systems, sub-
systems, assemblies, and components. 

  United  Space Alliance,  which  is  responsible  for  both 
Orbiter  integration  and  Shuttle  Safety  Reliability  and 
Quality Assurance,  delegates  hazard  analysis  to  Boe-
ing.  However,  as  of  2001,  the  Shuttle  Program  no 
longer  requires  Boeing  to  conduct  integrated  hazard 
analyses. Instead, Boeing now performs hazard analysis 
only  at  the  sub-system  level.  In  other  words,  Boeing 
analyzes  hazards  to  components  and  elements,  but  is 
not required to consider the Shuttle as a whole. Since 
the current Failure Mode Effects Analysis/Critical Item 
List process is designed for bottom-up analysis at the 
component level, it cannot effectively support the kind 
of “top-down” hazard analysis that is needed to inform 
managers on risk trends and identify potentially harmful 
interactions between systems. 

  The  Critical  Item  List  (CIL)  tracks  5,396  individual 
Shuttle  hazards,  of  which  4,222  are  termed  “Critical-

SPACE SHUTTLE SAFETY UPGRADE 
PROGRAM
NASA presented a Space Shuttle Safety Upgrade Initiative 
to Congress as part of its Fiscal Year 2001 budget in March 
2000. This initiative sought to create a “Pro-active upgrade 
program to keep Shuttle flying safely and efficiently to 2012 
and beyond to meet agency commitments and goals for hu-
man access to space.” 

The  planned  Shuttle  safety  upgrades  included:  Electric 
Auxiliary Power Unit, Improved Main Landing Gear Tire, 
Orbiter Cockpit/Avionics Upgrades, Space Shuttle Main En-
gine Advanced Health Management System, Block III Space 
Shuttle  Main  Engine,  Solid  Rocket  Booster  Thrust  Vector 
Control/Auxiliary  Power  Unit  Upgrades  Plan,  Redesigned 
Solid Rocket Motor – Propellant Grain Geometry Modifica-
tion, and External Tank Upgrades – Friction Stir Weld. The 
plan called for the upgrades to be completed by 2008.

However, as discussed in Chapter 5, every proposed safety 
upgrade – with a few exceptions – was either not approved 
or was deferred. 

The irony of the Space Shuttle Safety Upgrade Program was 
that  the  strategy  placed  emphasis  on  keeping  the  “Shuttle 
flying  safely  and  efficiently  to  2012  and  beyond,”  yet  the 
Space  Flight  Leadership  Council  accepted  the  upgrades 
only as long as they were financially feasible. Funding a 
safety upgrade in order to fly safely, and then canceling it 
for budgetary reasons, makes the concept of mission safety 
rather hollow.

ity  1/1R.”  Of  those,  3,233  have  waivers.  CRIT  1/1R 
component failures are defined as those that will result 
in  loss  of  the  Orbiter  and  crew.  Waivers  are  granted 
whenever  a  Critical  Item  List  component  cannot  be 
redesigned or replaced. More than 36 percent of these 
waivers have not been reviewed in 10 years, a sign that 
NASA is not aggressively monitoring changes in sys-
tem risk. 

  It is worth noting that the Shuttleʼs Thermal Protection 
System is on the Critical Item List, and an existing haz-
ard analysis and hazard report deals with debris strikes. 
As discussed in Chapter 6, Hazard Report #37 is inef-
fectual as a decision aid, yet the Shuttle Program never 
challenged  its  validity  at  the  pivotal  STS-113  Flight 
Readiness Review.

  Although the Shuttle Program has undoubtedly learned 
a great deal about the technological limitations inher-
ent  in  Shuttle  operations,  it  is  equally  clear  that  risk 
–  as  represented  by  the  number  of  critical  items  list 
and waivers – has grown substantially without a vigor-
ous effort to assess and reduce technical problems that 
increase risk. An information system bulging with over 
5,000 critical items and 3,200 waivers is exceedingly 
difficult to manage.

•  Hazard Reports: Hazard reports, written either by the 
Space Shuttle Program or a contractor, document con-
ditions that threaten the safe operation of the Shuttle. 
Managers use these reports to evaluate risk and justify 
flight.36  During  mission  preparations,  contractors  and 
Centers  review  all  baseline  hazard  reports  to  ensure 
they are current and technically correct. 

  Board investigators found that a large number of hazard 
reports contained subjective and qualitative judgments, 
such  as  “believed”  and  “based  on  experience  from 
previous flights this hazard is an ʻAccepted Risk.ʼ” A 
critical  ingredient  of  a  healthy  safety  program  is  the 
rigorous implementation of technical standards. These 
standards  must  include  more  than  hazard  analysis  or 
low-level technical activities. Standards must integrate 
project engineering and management activities. Finally, 
a mechanism for feedback on the effectiveness of sys-
tem  safety  engineering  and  management  needs  to  be 
built into procedures to learn if safety engineering and 
management methods are weakening over time.

Dysfunctional Databases

In  its  investigation,  the  Board  found  that  the  information 
systems  that  support  the  Shuttle  program  are  extremely 
cumbersome and difficult to use in decision-making at any 
level. For obvious reasons, these shortcomings imperil the 
Shuttle Programʼs ability to disseminate and share critical 
information among  its  many  layers. This  section explores 
the report databases that are crucial to effective risk man-
agement.

•  Problem  Reporting  and  Corrective  Action:  The 
Problem  Reporting  and  Corrective  Action  database 

records  any  non-conformances  (instances  in  which  a 
requirement is not met). Formerly, different Centers and 
contractors used the Problem Reporting and Corrective 
Action database differently, which prevented compari-
sons  across  the  database.  NASA  recently  initiated  an 
effort to integrate these databases to permit anyone in 
the agency to access information from different Centers. 
This system, Web Program Compliance Assurance and 
Status  System  (WEBPCASS),  is  supposed  to  provide 
easier access to consolidated information and facilitates 
higher-level searches. 

  However, NASA safety managers have complained that 
the  system  is  too  time-consuming  and  cumbersome. 
Only employees trained on the database seem capable 
of  using  WEBPCASS  effectively.  One  particularly 
frustrating aspect of which the Board is acutely aware is 
the databaseʼs waiver section. It is a critical information 
source, but only the most expert users can employ it ef-
fectively. The database is also incomplete. For instance, 
in the case of foam strikes on the Thermal Protection 
System,  only  strikes  that  were  declared  “In-Fight 
Anomalies”  are  added  to  the  Problem  Reporting  and 
Corrective Action database, which masks the full extent 
of the foam debris trends.

•  Lessons Learned Information System: The Lessons 
Learned Information System database is a much simpler 
system to use, and it can assist with hazard identification 
and risk assessment. However, personnel familiar with 
the Lessons Learned Information System indicate that 
design engineers and mission assurance personnel use it 
only on an ad hoc basis, thereby limiting its utility. The 
Board is not the first to note such deficiencies. Numer-
ous reports, including most recently a General Account-
ing Office 2001 report, highlighted fundamental weak-
nesses in the collection and sharing of lessons learned 
by program and project managers.37 

Conclusions

Throughout the course of this investigation, the Board found 
that the Shuttle Programʼs complexity demands highly ef-
fective  communication.  Yet  integrated  hazard  reports  and 
risk analyses are rarely communicated effectively, nor are 
the many databases used by Shuttle Program engineers and 
managers  capable  of  translating  operational  experiences 
into  effective  risk  management  practices.  Although  the 
Space Shuttle system has conducted a relatively small num-
ber of missions, there is more than enough data to generate 
performance trends. As it is currently structured, the Shuttle 
Program does not use data-driven safety methodologies to 
their fullest advantage.
7.5  ORGANIZATIONAL CAUSES: IMPACT OF 
 
A FLAWED SAFETY CULTURE ON STS-107

In this section, the Board examines how and why an array 
of processes, groups, and individuals in the Shuttle Program 
failed  to  appreciate  the  severity  and  implications  of  the 
foam strike on STS-107. The Board believes that the Shuttle 
Program should have been able to detect the foam trend and

more fully appreciate the danger it represented. Recall that 
“safety culture” refers to the collection of characteristics and 
attitudes in an organization – promoted by its leaders and in-
ternalized by its members – that makes safety an overriding 
priority. In the following analysis, the Board outlines short-
comings in the Space Shuttle Program, Debris Assessment 
Team, and Mission Management Team that resulted from a 
flawed safety culture. 

Shuttle Program Shortcomings

The flight readiness process, which involves every organi-
zation affiliated with a Shuttle mission, missed the danger 
signals in the history of foam loss.

Generally, the higher information is transmitted in a hierar-
chy, the more it gets “rolled-up,” abbreviated, and simpli-
fied.  Sometimes  information  gets  lost  altogether,  as  weak 
signals drop from memos, problem identification systems, 
and  formal  presentations. The  same  conclusions,  repeated 
over time, can result in problems eventually being deemed 
non-problems. An  extraordinary  example  of  this  phenom-
enon is how Shuttle Program managers assumed the foam 
strike on STS-112 was not a warning sign (see Chapter 6). 

During  the  STS-113  Flight  Readiness  Review,  the  bipod 
foam strike to STS-112 was rationalized by simply restat-
ing earlier assessments of foam loss. The question of why 
bipod foam would detach and strike a Solid Rocket Booster 
spawned  no  further  analysis  or  heightened  curiosity;  nor 
did anyone challenge the weakness of External Tank Proj-
ect  Managerʼs  argument  that  backed  launching  the  next 
mission. After STS-113ʼs successful flight, once again the 
STS-112 foam event was not discussed at the STS-107 Flight 
Readiness  Review.  The  failure  to  mention  an  outstanding 
technical  anomaly,  even  if  not  technically  a  violation  of 
NASAʼs own procedures, desensitized the Shuttle Program 
to the dangers of foam striking the Thermal Protection Sys-
tem, and demonstrated just how easily the flight preparation 
process can be compromised. In short, the dangers of bipod 
foam got “rolled-up,” which resulted in a missed opportuni-
ty to make Shuttle managers aware that the Shuttle required, 
and did not yet have a fix for the problem.

Once the Columbia foam strike was discovered, the Mission 
Management Team Chairperson asked for the rationale the 
STS-113 Flight Readiness Review used to launch in spite 
of the STS-112 foam strike. In her e-mail, she admitted that 
the analysis used to continue flying was, in a word, “lousy” 
(Chapter 6). This admission – that the rationale to fly was 
rubber-stamped – is, to say the least, unsettling.

The  Flight  Readiness  process  is  supposed  to  be  shielded 
from outside influence, and is viewed as both rigorous and 
systematic. Yet the Shuttle Program is inevitably influenced 
by external factors, including, in the case of the STS-107, 
schedule  demands.  Collectively,  such  factors  shape  how 
the Program establishes mission schedules and sets budget 
priorities, which affects safety oversight, workforce levels, 
facility maintenance, and contractor workloads. Ultimately, 
external expectations and pressures impact even data collec-
tion, trend analysis, information development, and the re-

porting and disposition of anomalies. These realities contra-
dict NASAʼs optimistic belief that pre-flight reviews provide 
true safeguards against unacceptable hazards. The schedule 
pressure to launch International Space Station Node 2 is a 
powerful example of this point (Section 6.2). 

The premium placed on maintaining an operational sched-
ule, combined with ever-decreasing resources, gradually led 
Shuttle managers and engineers to miss signals of potential 
danger.  Foam  strikes  on  the  Orbiterʼs  Thermal  Protec-
tion  System,  no  matter  what  the  size  of  the  debris,  were 
“normalized” and accepted as not being a “safety-of-flight 
risk.” Clearly, the risk of Thermal Protection damage due to 
such a strike needed to be better understood in quantifiable 
terms. External Tank foam loss should have been eliminated 
or  mitigated  with  redundant  layers  of  protection.  If  there 
was in fact a strong safety culture at NASA, safety experts 
would have had the authority to test the actual resilience of 
the leading edge Reinforced Carbon-Carbon panels, as the 
Board has done.  

Debris Assessment Team Shortcomings

Chapter Six details the Debris Assessment Teamʼs efforts to 
obtain additional imagery of Columbia. When managers in 
the Shuttle Program denied the teamʼs request for imagery, 
the Debris Assessment Team was put in the untenable posi-
tion of having to prove that a safety-of-flight issue existed 
without the very images that would permit such a determina-
tion. This is precisely the opposite of how an effective safety 
culture would act. Organizations that deal with high-risk op-
erations must always have a healthy fear of failure – opera-
tions must be proved safe, rather than the other way around. 
NASA inverted this burden of proof.

Another crucial failure involves the Boeing engineers who 
conducted the Crater analysis. The Debris Assessment Team 
relied on the inputs of these engineers along with many oth-
ers to assess the potential damage caused by the foam strike. 
Prior to STS-107, Crater analysis was the responsibility of 
a team at Boeingʼs Huntington Beach facility in California, 
but  this  responsibility  had  recently  been  transferred  to 
Boeingʼs Houston office. In October 2002, the Shuttle Pro-
gram completed a risk assessment that predicted the move of 
Boeing functions from Huntington Beach to Houston would 
increase risk to Shuttle missions through the end of 2003, 
because of the small number of experienced engineers who 
were willing to relocate. To mitigate this risk, NASA and 
United  Space Alliance  developed  a  transition  plan  to  run 
through January 2003. 

The  Board  has  discovered  that  the  implementation  of  the 
transition plan was incomplete and that training of replace-
ment  personnel  was  not  uniform.  STS-107  was  the  first 
mission  during  which  Johnson-based  Boeing  engineers 
conducted  analysis  without  guidance  and  oversight  from 
engineers at Huntington Beach. 

Even though STS-107ʼs debris strike was 400 times larger 
than the objects Crater is designed to model, neither John-
son engineers nor Program managers appealed for assistance 
from  the  more  experienced  Huntington  Beach  engineers,

ENGINEERING BY VIEWGRAPHS

The Debris Assessment Team presented its analysis in a formal 
briefing to the Mission Evaluation Room that relied on Power-
Point slides from Boeing. When engineering analyses and risk 
assessments are condensed to fit on a standard form or overhead 
slide, information is inevitably lost. In  the process,  the prior-
ity assigned to information can be easily misrepresented by its 
placement on a chart and the language that is used. Dr. Edward 
Tufte of Yale University, an expert in information presentation 
who also researched communications failures in the Challenger 
accident, studied how the slides used by the Debris Assessment 
Team in their briefing to the Mission Evaluation Room misrep-
resented key information.38

The slide created six levels of hierarchy, signified by the title 
and the symbols to the left of each line. These levels prioritized 
information that was already contained in 11 simple sentences. 
Tufte also notes that the title is confusing. “Review of Test Data 
Indicates Conservatism” refers not to the predicted tile damage, 
but to the choice of test models used to predict the damage. 

Only at the bottom of the slide do engineers state a key piece of 
information: that one estimate of the debris that struck Columbia 
was 640 times larger than the data used to calibrate the model on 
which engineers based their damage assessments. (Later analy-
sis showed that the debris object was actually 400 times larger). 
This  difference  led  Tufte  to  suggest  that  a  more  appropriate 
headline would be “Review of Test Data Indicates Irrelevance 
of Two Models.” 39 

Tufte  also  criticized  the  sloppy  language  on  the  slide.  “The 
vaguely quantitative words ʻsignificantʼ and ʻsignificantlyʼ are 
used 5 times on this slide,” he notes, “with de facto meanings 
ranging from ʻdetectable in largely irrelevant calibration case 
studyʼ to ʻan amount of damage so that everyone diesʼ to ʻa dif-
ference of 640-fold.ʼ ” 40 Another example of sloppiness is that 
“cubic inches” is written inconsistently: “3cu. In,” “1920cu in,” 
and “3 cu in.” While such inconsistencies might seem minor, in 
highly technical fields like aerospace engineering a misplaced 
decimal  point  or  mistaken  unit  of  measurement  can  easily 
engender  inconsistencies  and  inaccuracies.  In  another  phrase 
“Test results do show that it is possible at sufficient mass and 
velocity,” the word “it” actually refers to “damage to the protec-
tive tiles.” 

As information gets passed up an organization hierarchy, from 
people  who  do  analysis  to  mid-level  managers  to  high-level 
leadership, key explanations and supporting information is fil-
tered out. In this context, it is easy to understand how a senior 
manager might read this PowerPoint slide and not realize that it 
addresses a life-threatening situation.

At  many  points  during  its  investigation,  the  Board  was  sur-
prised to receive similar presentation slides from NASA offi-
cials in place of technical reports. The Board views the endemic 
use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as 
an  illustration  of  the  problematic  methods  of  technical  com-
munication at NASA.

The vaguely quantitative words "significant" and
"significantly" are used 5 times on this slide, with de facto
meanings ranging from "detectable in largely irrelevant
calibration case study" to "an amount of damage so that
everyone dies" to "a difference of 640-fold."  None of
these 5 usages appears to refer to the technical meaning
of "statistical significance."
The low resolution of PowerPoint slides promotes
the use of compressed phrases like "Tile Penetration."
As is the case here, such phrases may well be ambiquous.
(The low resolution and large font generate 3 typographic
orphans, lonely words dangling on a seperate line.)

This vague pronoun reference "it" alludes to damage
to the protective tiles,which caused the destruction of the
Columbia.  The slide weakens important material with
ambiquous language (sentence fragments, passive voice,
multiple meanings of "significant").  The 3 reports
were created by engineers for high-level NASA officials 
who were deciding whether the threat of wing damage
required further investigation before the Columbia
attempted return.  The officials were satisfied that the
reports indicated that the Columbia was not in danger,
and no attempts to further examine the threat were
made.  The slides were part of an oral presentation and
also were circulated as e-mail attachments. 
In this slide the same unit of measure for volume
(cubic inches) is shown a different way every time

3cu. in         1920cu. in        3 cu. in

rather than in clear and tidy exponential form 1920 in3.
Perhaps the available font cannot show exponents.
Shakiness in units of measurement provokes concern.
Slides that use hierarchical bullet-outlines here do not
handle statistical data and scientific notation gracefully.
If PowerPoint is a corporate-mandated format for all
engineering reports, then some competent scientific
typography (rather than the PP market-pitch style) is
essential.  In this slide, the typography is so choppy and
clunky that it impedes understanding.

who might have cautioned against using Crater so far out-
side its validated limits. Nor did safety personnel provide 
any additional oversight. NASA failed to connect the dots: 
the  engineers  who  misinterpreted  Crater  –  a  tool  already 
unsuited to the task at hand – were the very ones the Shuttle 
Program  identified  as  engendering  the  most  risk  in  their 
transition from Huntington Beach. The Board views this ex-
ample as characteristic of the greater turbulence the Shuttle 
Program  experienced  in  the  decade  before  Columbia  as  a 
result of workforce reductions and management reforms.

Mission Management Team Shortcomings

In the Boardʼs view, the decision to fly STS-113 without a 
compelling explanation for why bipod foam had separated 
on ascent during the preceding mission, combined with the 
low number of Mission Management Team meetings during 
STS-107,  indicates  that  the  Shuttle  Program  had  become 
overconfident. Over time, the organization determined it did 
not need daily meetings during a mission, despite regula-
tions that state otherwise. 

Status update meetings should provide an opportunity to raise 
concerns and hold discussions across structural and technical 
boundaries.  The  leader  of  such  meetings  must  encourage 
participation and guarantee that problems are assessed and 
resolved fully. All voices must be heard, which can be dif-
ficult when facing a hierarchy. An employeeʼs location in the 
hierarchy can encourage silence. Organizations interested in 
safety must take steps to guarantee that all relevant informa-
tion is presented to decision-makers. This did not happen in 
the meetings during the Columbia mission (see Chapter 6). 
For instance, e-mails from engineers at Johnson and Langley 
conveyed the depth of their concern about the foam strike, 
the questions they had about its implications, and the actions 
they wanted to take as a follow-up. However, these e-mails 
did not reach the Mission Management Team. 

The failure to convey the urgency of engineering concerns 
was caused, at least in part, by organizational structure and 
spheres  of  authority.  The  Langley  e-mails  were  circulated 
among co-workers at Johnson who explored the possible ef-
fects of the foam strike and its consequences for landing. Yet, 
like Debris Assessment Team Co-Chair Rodney Rocha, they 
kept their concerns within local channels and did not forward 
them to the Mission Management Team. They were separated 
from the decision-making process by distance and rank. 

Similarly, Mission Management Team participants felt pres-
sured to remain quiet unless discussion turned to their par-
ticular area of technological or system expertise, and, even 
then,  to  be  brief.  The  initial  damage  assessment  briefing 
prepared for the Mission Evaluation Room was cut down 
considerably in order to make it “fit” the schedule. Even so, 
it took 40 minutes. It was cut down further to a three-minute 
discussion topic at the Mission Management Team. Tapes of 
STS-107 Mission Management Team sessions reveal a no-
ticeable “rush” by the meetingʼs leader to the preconceived 
bottom line that there was “no safety-of-flight” issue (see 
Chapter 6). Program managers created huge barriers against 
dissenting  opinions  by  stating  preconceived  conclusions 
based on subjective knowledge and experience, rather than 

on solid data. Managers demonstrated little concern for mis-
sion safety. 

Organizations with strong safety cultures generally acknowl-
edge that a leaderʼs best response to unanimous consent is to 
play devilʼs advocate and encourage an exhaustive debate. 
Mission Management Team leaders failed to seek out such 
minority  opinions.  Imagine  the  difference  if  any  Shuttle 
manager had simply asked, “Prove to me that Columbia has 
not been harmed.”

Similarly, organizations committed to effective communica-
tion seek avenues through which unidentified concerns and 
dissenting insights can be raised, so that weak signals are 
not lost in background noise. Common methods of bringing 
minority opinions to the fore include hazard reports, sug-
gestion programs, and empowering employees to call “time 
out” (Chapter 10). For these methods to be effective, they 
must mitigate the fear of retribution, and management and 
technical staff must pay attention. Shuttle Program hazard 
reporting is seldom used, safety time outs are at times disre-
garded, and informal efforts to gain support are squelched. 
The very fact that engineers felt inclined to conduct simulat-
ed blown tire landings at Ames “after hours,” indicates their 
reluctance to bring the concern up in established channels.

Safety Shortcomings

The  Board  believes  that  the  safety  organization,  due  to  a 
lack of capability and resources independent of the Shuttle 
Program, was not an effective voice in discussing technical 
issues  or  mission  operations  pertaining  to  STS-107.  The 
safety  personnel  present  in  the  Debris Assessment  Team, 
Mission Evaluation Room, and on the Mission Management 
Team were largely silent during the events leading up to the 
loss of Columbia. That silence was not merely a failure of 
safety, but a failure of the entire organization.
7.6  FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The  evidence  that  supports  the  organizational  causes  also 
led the Board to conclude that NASAʼs current organization, 
which  combines  in  the  Shuttle  Program  all  authority  and 
responsibility for schedule, cost, manifest, safety, technical 
requirements, and waivers to technical requirements, is not 
an effective check and balance to achieve safety and mission 
assurance.  Further,  NASAʼs  Office  of  Safety  and  Mission 
Assurance  does  not  have  the  independence  and  authority 
that the Board and many outside reviews believe is neces-
sary.  Consequently,  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  does  not 
consistently demonstrate the characteristics of organizations 
that effectively manage high risk. Therefore, the Board of-
fers the following Findings and Recommendations:

Findings:

F7.1-1 

Throughout  its  history,  NASA  has  consistently 
struggled to achieve viable safety programs and 
adjust  them  to  the  constraints  and  vagaries  of 
changing budgets. Yet, according to multiple high 
level independent reviews, NASAʼs safety system 
has fallen short of the mark.

communicate potential problems throughout the 
organization.

F7.4-13  There are conflicting roles, responsibilities, and 
guidance  in  the  Space  Shuttle  safety  programs. 
The Safety & Mission Assurance Pre-Launch As-
sessment Review process is not recognized by the 
Space Shuttle Program as a requirement that must 
be followed (NSTS 22778). Failure to consistent-
ly apply the Pre-Launch Assessment Review as a 
requirements document creates confusion about 
roles and responsibilities in the NASA safety or-
ganization.

Recommendations:

R7.5-1 

Establish  an  independent  Technical  Engineer-
ing  Authority  that  is  responsible  for  technical 
requirements and all waivers to them, and will 
build  a  disciplined,  systematic  approach  to 
identifying,  analyzing,  and  controlling  hazards 
throughout the life cycle of the Shuttle System. 
The independent technical authority does the fol-
lowing as a minimum: 

•  Develop and maintain technical standards 
for all Space Shuttle Program projects and 
elements

•  Be the sole waiver-granting authority for 

all technical standards

•  Conduct trend and risk analysis at the sub-

system, system, and enterprise levels

•  Own the failure mode, effects analysis and 

hazard reporting systems

•  Conduct integrated hazard analysis
•  Decide  what  is  and  is  not  an  anomalous 

event

•  Independently verify launch readiness
•  Approve the provisions of the recertifica-
tion program called for in Recommenda-
tion R9.1-1

 

R7.5-2 

R7.5-3 

The Technical Engineering Authority should be 
funded  directly  from  NASA  Headquarters,  and 
should have no connection to or responsibility for 
schedule or program cost. 
NASA Headquarters Office of Safety and Mission 
Assurance should have direct line authority over 
the entire Space Shuttle Program safety organiza-
tion and should be independently resourced.
Reorganize the Space Shuttle Integration Office 
to make it capable of integrating all elements of 
the Space Shuttle Program, including the Orbiter.

F7.4-5 

F7.4-6 

The Associate Administrator for Safety and Mis-
sion Assurance is not responsible for safety and 
mission assurance execution, as intended by the 
Rogers Commission, but is responsible for Safety 
and Mission Assurance policy, advice, coordina-
tion,  and  budgets.  This  view  is  consistent  with 
NASAʼs  recent  philosophy  of  management  at  a 
strategic level at NASA Headquarters but contrary 
to the Rogersʼ Commission recommendation.
Safety and Mission Assurance organizations sup-
porting the Shuttle Program are largely dependent 
upon  the  Program  for  funding,  which  hampers 
their status as independent advisors.
Over the last two decades, little to no progress has 
been made toward attaining integrated, indepen-
dent, and detailed analyses of risk to the Space 
Shuttle system.
System  safety  engineering  and  management  is 
separated  from  mainstream  engineering,  is  not 
vigorous enough to have an impact on system de-
sign, and is hidden in the other safety disciplines 
at NASA Headquarters.
Risk information and data from hazard analyses 
are not communicated effectively to the risk as-
sessment  and  mission  assurance  processes. The 
Board  could  not  find  adequate  application  of  a 
process,  database,  or  metric  analysis  tool  that 
took  an  integrated,  systemic  view  of  the  entire 
Space Shuttle system.
The  Space  Shuttle  Systems  Integration  Office 
handles  all  Shuttle  systems  except  the  Orbiter. 
Therefore, it is not a true integration office. 

F7.4-9 

F7.4-8 

F7.4-7  When the Integration Office convenes the Inte-
gration Control Board, the Orbiter Office usually 
does not send a representative, and its staff makes 
verbal inputs only when requested.
The  Integration  office  did  not  have  continuous 
responsibility  to  integrate  responses  to  bipod 
foam shedding from various offices. Sometimes 
the Orbiter Office had responsibility, sometimes 
the External Tank Office at Marshall Space Flight 
Center had responsibility, and sometime the bi-
pod shedding did not result in any designation of 
an In-Flight Anomaly. Integration did not occur.
NASA information databases such as The Prob-
lem  Reporting  and  Corrective  Action  and  the 
Web Program Compliance Assurance and Status 
System are marginally effective decision tools.

F7.4-10  Senior Safety, Reliability & Quality Assurance 
and  element  managers  do  not  use  the  Lessons 
Learned Information System when making de-
cisions.  NASA  subsequently  does  not  have  a 
constructive program to use past lessons to edu-
cate  engineers,  managers,  astronauts,  or  safety 
personnel. 

F7.4-11  The Space Shuttle Program has a wealth of data 
tucked  away  in  multiple  databases  without  a 
convenient way to integrate and use the data for 
management, engineering, or safety decisions. 

F7.4-12  The dependence of Safety, Reliability & Quality 
Assurance  personnel  on  Shuttle  Program  sup-
port limits their ability to oversee operations and

CHAPTER 8

History As Cause:
Columbia and Challenger

The  Board  began  its  investigation  with  two  central  ques-
tions about NASA decisions. Why did NASA continue to fly 
with known foam debris problems in the years preceding the 
Columbia launch, and why did NASA managers conclude 
that  the  foam  debris  strike  81.9  seconds  into  Columbiaʼs 
flight was not a threat to the safety of the mission, despite 
the concerns of their engineers? 
8.1  ECHOES OF CHALLENGER 

As  the  investigation  progressed,  Board  member  Dr.  Sally 
Ride, who also served on the Rogers Commission, observed 
that there were “echoes” of Challenger in Columbia. Ironi-
cally, the Rogers Commission investigation into Challenger 
started with two remarkably similar central questions: Why 
did NASA continue to fly with known O-ring erosion prob-
lems in the years before the Challenger launch, and why, on 
the eve of the Challenger launch, did NASA managers decide 
that launching the mission in such cold temperatures was an 
acceptable risk, despite the concerns of their engineers?

The echoes did not stop there. The foam debris hit was not 
the single cause of the Columbia accident, just as the failure 
of the joint seal that permitted O-ring erosion was not the 
single cause of Challenger. Both Columbia and Challenger 
were lost also because of the failure of NASAʼs organiza-
tional system. Part Two of this report cites failures of the 
three parts of NASAʼs organizational system. This chapter 
shows how previous political, budgetary, and policy deci-
sions by leaders at the White House, Congress, and NASA 
(Chapter 5) impacted the Space Shuttle Programʼs structure, 
culture, and safety system (Chapter 7), and how these in turn 
resulted in flawed decision-making (Chapter 6) for both ac-
cidents. The explanation is about system effects: how actions 
taken in one layer of NASAʼs organizational system impact 
other layers. History is not just a backdrop or a scene-setter. 
History is cause. History set the Columbia and Challenger 
accidents  in  motion. Although  Part  Two  is  separated  into 
chapters and sections to make clear what happened in the 
political environment, the organization, and managersʼ and 

engineersʼ decision-making, the three worked together. Each 
is a critical link in the causal chain. 

This  chapter  shows  that  both  accidents  were  “failures  of 
foresight” in which history played a prominent role.1 First, 
the  history  of  engineering  decisions  on  foam  and  O-ring 
incidents had identical trajectories that “normalized” these 
anomalies, so that flying with these flaws became routine 
and acceptable. Second, NASA history had an effect. In re-
sponse to White House and Congressional mandates, NASA 
leaders  took  actions  that  created  systemic  organizational 
flaws at the time of Challenger that were also present for 
Columbia. The final section compares the two critical deci-
sion sequences immediately before the loss of both Orbit-
ers – the pre-launch teleconference for Challenger and the 
post-launch foam strike discussions for Columbia. It shows 
history again at work: how past definitions of risk combined 
with systemic problems in the NASA organization caused 
both accidents. 

Connecting the parts of NASAʼs organizational system and 
drawing  the  parallels  with  Challenger  demonstrate  three 
things.  First,  despite  all  the  post-Challenger  changes  at 
NASA  and  the  agencyʼs  notable  achievements  since,  the 
causes of the institutional failure responsible for Challenger 
have  not  been  fixed.  Second,  the  Board  strongly  believes 
that  if  these  persistent,  systemic  flaws  are  not  resolved, 
the scene is set for another accident. Therefore, the recom-
mendations for change are not only for fixing the Shuttleʼs 
technical system, but also for fixing each part of the orga-
nizational system that produced Columbiaʼs failure. Third, 
the Boardʼs focus on the context in which decision making 
occurred does not mean that individuals are not responsible 
and accountable. To the contrary, individuals always must 
assume responsibility for their actions. What it does mean 
is that NASAʼs problems cannot be solved simply by retire-
ments, resignations, or transferring personnel.2 

The  constraints  under  which  the  agency  has  operated 
throughout  the  Shuttle  Program  have  contributed  to  both

Shuttle  accidents.  Although  NASA  leaders  have  played 
an  important  role,  these  constraints  were  not  entirely  of 
NASAʼs own making. The White House and Congress must 
recognize the role of their decisions in this accident and take 
responsibility for safety in the future. 
8.2  FAILURES OF FORESIGHT: TWO DECISION 
HISTORIES AND THE NORMALIZATION OF 
DEVIANCE

Foam loss may have occurred on all missions, and left bipod 
ramp  foam  loss  occurred  on  10  percent  of  the  flights  for 
which  visible  evidence  exists. The  Board  had  a  hard  time 
understanding  how,  after  the  bitter  lessons  of  Challenger, 
NASA could have failed to identify a similar trend. Rather 
than  view  the  foam  decision  only  in  hindsight,  the  Board 
tried to see the foam incidents as NASA engineers and man-
agers saw them as they made their decisions. This section 
gives  an  insider  perspective:  how  NASA  defined  risk  and 
how those definitions changed over time for both foam debris 
hits and O-ring erosion. In both cases, engineers and manag-
ers conducting risk assessments continually normalized the 
technical deviations they found.3 In all official engineering 
analyses and launch recommendations prior to the accidents, 
evidence that the design was not performing as expected was 
reinterpreted  as  acceptable  and  non-deviant,  which  dimin-
ished perceptions of risk throughout the agency.

The  initial  Shuttle  design  predicted  neither  foam  debris 
problems nor poor sealing action of the Solid Rocket Boost-
er joints. To experience either on a mission was a violation 
of  design  specifications. These  anomalies  were  signals  of 
potential danger, not something to be tolerated, but in both 
cases after the first incident the engineering analysis con-
cluded that the design could tolerate the damage. These en-
gineers decided to implement a temporary fix and/or accept 
the risk, and fly. For both O-rings and foam, that first deci-
sion was a turning point. It established a precedent for ac-
cepting, rather than eliminating, these technical deviations. 
As a result of this new classification, subsequent incidents of 
O-ring erosion or foam debris strikes were not defined as 
signals of danger, but as evidence that the design was now 
acting  as  predicted.  Engineers  and  managers  incorporated 
worsening anomalies into the engineering experience base, 
which functioned as an elastic waistband, expanding to hold 
larger deviations from the original design. Anomalies that 
did not lead to catastrophic failure were treated as a source 
of valid engineering data that justified further flights. These 
anomalies were translated into a safety margin that was ex-
tremely influential, allowing engineers and managers to add 
incrementally to the amount and seriousness of damage that 
was acceptable. Both O-ring erosion and foam debris events 
were  repeatedly  “addressed”  in  NASAʼs  Flight  Readiness 
Reviews but never fully resolved. In both cases, the engi-
neering analysis was incomplete and inadequate. Engineers 
understood what was happening, but they never understood 
why. NASA continued to implement a series of small correc-
tive actions, living with the problems until it was too late.4 

NASA documents show how official classifications of risk 
were downgraded over time.5 Program managers designated 
both the foam problems and O-ring erosion as “acceptable 

risks” in Flight Readiness Reviews. NASA managers also 
assigned each bipod foam event In-Flight Anomaly status, 
and  then  removed  the  designation  as  corrective  actions 
were implemented. But when major bipod foam-shedding 
occurred on STS-112 in October 2002, Program manage-
ment did not assign an In-Flight Anomaly. Instead, it down-
graded the problem to the lower status of an “action” item. 
Before Challenger, the problematic Solid Rocket Booster 
joint had been elevated to a Criticality 1 item on NASAʼs 
Critical  Items  List,  which  ranked  Shuttle  components  by 
failure consequences and noted why each was an accept-
able risk. The joint was later demoted to a Criticality 1-R 
(redundant),  and  then  in  the  month  before  Challengerʼs 
launch was “closed out” of the problem-reporting system. 
Prior to both accidents, this demotion from high-risk item 
to low-risk item was very similar, but with some important 
differences.  Damaging  the  Orbiterʼs  Thermal  Protection 
System, especially its fragile tiles, was normalized even be-
fore Shuttle launches began: it was expected due to forces 
at launch, orbit, and re-entry.6 So normal was replacement 
of Thermal Protection System materials that NASA manag-
ers budgeted for tile cost and turnaround maintenance time 
from the start. 

It was a small and logical next step for the discovery of foam 
debris damage to the tiles to be viewed by NASA as part of an 
already existing maintenance problem, an assessment based 
on experience, not on a thorough hazard analysis. Foam de-
bris  anomalies  came  to  be  categorized  by  the  reassuring 
term “in-family,” a formal classification indicating that new 
occurrences of an anomaly were within the engineering ex-
perience base. “In-family” was a strange term indeed for a 
violation of system requirements. Although “in-family” was 
a designation introduced post-Challenger to separate prob-
lems by seriousness so that “out-of-family” problems got 
more attention, by definition the problems that were shifted 
into the lesser “in-family” category got less attention. The 
Boardʼs investigation uncovered no paper trail showing es-
calating concern about the foam problem like the one that 
Solid  Rocket  Booster  engineers  left  prior  to Challenger.7 
So ingrained was the agencyʼs belief that foam debris was 
not a threat to flight safety that in press briefings after the 
Columbia  accident,  the  Space  Shuttle  Program  Manager 
still discounted the foam as a probable cause, saying that 
Shuttle managers were “comfortable” with their previous 
risk assessments.

From the beginning, NASAʼs belief about both these prob-
lems was affected by the fact that engineers were evaluat-
ing them in a work environment where technical problems 
were  normal.  Although  management  treated  the  Shuttle 
as  operational,  it  was  in  reality  an  experimental  vehicle. 
Many  anomalies  were  expected  on  each  mission. Against 
this backdrop, an anomaly was not in itself a warning sign 
of impending catastrophe. Another contributing factor was 
that both foam debris strikes and O-ring erosion events were 
examined  separately,  one  at  a  time.  Individual  incidents 
were  not  read  by  engineers  as  strong  signals  of  danger. 
What NASA engineers and managers saw were pieces of ill-
structured problems.8 An incident of O-ring erosion or foam 
bipod debris would be followed by several launches where 
the  machine  behaved  properly,  so  that  signals  of  danger

were followed by all-clear signals – in other words, NASA 
managers  and  engineers  were  receiving  mixed  signals.9 
Some signals defined as weak at the time were, in retrospect, 
warnings of danger. Foam debris damaged tile was assumed 
(erroneously) not to pose a danger to the wing. If a primary 
O-ring  failed,  the  secondary  was  assumed  (erroneously) 
to  provide  a  backup.  Finally,  because  foam  debris  strikes 
were occurring frequently, like O-ring erosion in the years 
before Challenger, foam anomalies became routine signals 
– a normal part of Shuttle operations, not signals of danger. 
Other anomalies gave signals that were strong, like wiring 
malfunctions or the cracked balls in Ball Strut Tie Rod As-
semblies, which had a clear relationship to a “loss of mis-
sion.” On those occasions, NASA stood down from launch, 
sometimes for months, while the problems were corrected. 
In contrast, foam debris and eroding O-rings were defined 
as  nagging  issues  of  seemingly  little  consequence.  Their 
significance became clear only in retrospect, after lives had 
been lost. 

History became cause as the repeating pattern of anomalies 
was ratified as safe in Flight Readiness Reviews. The official 
definitions of risk assigned to each anomaly in Flight Readi-
ness  Reviews  limited  the  actions  taken  and  the  resources 
spent on these problems. Two examples of the road not taken 
and the devastating implications for the future occurred close 
in  time  to  both  accidents.  On  the  October  2002  launch  of 
STS-112,  a  large  piece  of  bipod  ramp  foam  hit  and  dam-
aged the External Tank Attachment ring on the Solid Rocket 
Booster skirt, a strong signal of danger 10 years after the last 
known  bipod  ramp  foam  event.  Prior  to  Challenger,  there 
was a comparable surprise. After a January 1985 launch, for 
which the Shuttle sat on the launch pad for three consecutive 
nights of unprecedented cold temperatures, engineers discov-
ered upon the Orbiterʼs return that hot gases had eroded the 
primary and reached the secondary O-ring, blackening the 
putty in between – an indication that the joint nearly failed. 

But accidents are not always preceded by a wake-up call.10 
In  1985,  engineers  realized  they  needed  data  on  the  rela-
tionship  between  cold  temperatures  and  O-ring  erosion. 
However, the task of getting better temperature data stayed 
on  the  back  burner  because  of  the  definition  of  risk:  the 
primary  erosion  was  within  the  experience  base;  the  sec-
ondary O-ring (thought to be redundant) was not damaged 
and, significantly, there was a low probability that such cold 
Florida temperatures would recur.11 The scorched putty, ini-
tially a strong signal, was redefined after analysis as weak. 
On the eve of the Challenger launch, when cold temperature 
became a concern, engineers had no test data on the effect 
of cold temperatures on O-ring erosion. Before Columbia, 
engineers  concluded  that  the  damage  from  the  STS-112 
foam hit in October 2002 was not a threat to flight safety. 
The logic was that, yes, the foam piece was large and there 
was damage, but no serious consequences followed. Further, 
a hit this size, like cold temperature, was a low-probability 
event. After analysis, the biggest foam hit to date was re-
defined as a weak signal. Similar self-defeating actions and 
inactions followed. Engineers were again dealing with the 
poor  quality  of  tracking  camera  images  of  strikes  during 
ascent. Yet  NASA  took  no  steps  to  improve  imagery  and 
took no immediate action to reduce the risk of bipod ramp 

foam shedding and potential damage to the Orbiter before 
Columbia. Furthermore, NASA performed no tests on what 
would happen if a wing leading edge were struck by bipod 
foam, even though foam had repeatedly separated from the 
External Tank. 

During  the  Challenger  investigation,  Rogers  Commis-
sion  member  Dr.  Richard  Feynman  famously  compared 
launching Shuttles with known problems to playing Russian 
roulette.12 But that characterization is only possible in hind-
sight. It is not how NASA personnel perceived the risks as 
they were being assessed, one launch at a time. Playing Rus-
sian roulette implies that the pistol-holder realizes that death 
might be imminent and still takes the risk. For both foam 
debris and O-ring erosion, fixes were in the works at the time 
of the accidents, but there was no rush to complete them be-
cause neither problem was defined as a show-stopper. Each 
time  an  incident  occurred,  the  Flight  Readiness  process 
declared it safe to continue flying. Taken one at a time, each 
decision seemed correct. The agency allocated attention and 
resources  to  these  two  problems  accordingly.  The  conse-
quences of living with both of these anomalies were, in its 
view, minor. Not all engineers agreed in the months immedi-
ately preceding Challenger, but the dominant view at NASA 
– the managerial view – was, as one manager put it, “we 
were  just  eroding  rubber  O-rings,”  which  was  a  low-cost 
problem.13 The financial consequences of foam debris also 
were relatively low: replacing tiles extended the turnaround 
time between launches. In both cases, NASA was comfort-
able with its analyses. Prior to each accident, the agency saw 
no greater consequences on the horizon.
8.3  SYSTEM EFFECTS: THE IMPACT OF HISTORY 

AND POLITICS ON RISKY WORK

The series of engineering decisions that normalized technical 
deviations shows one way that history became cause in both 
accidents. But NASAʼs own history encouraged this pattern 
of flying with known flaws. Seventeen years separated the 
two accidents. NASA Administrators, Congresses, and po-
litical administrations changed. However, NASAʼs political 
and budgetary situation remained the same in principle as it 
had been since the inception of the Shuttle Program. NASA 
remained a politicized and vulnerable agency, dependent on 
key political players who accepted NASAʼs ambitious pro-
posals and then imposed strict budget limits. Post-Challeng-
er policy decisions made by the White House, Congress, and 
NASA leadership resulted in the agency reproducing many 
of the failings identified by the Rogers Commission. Policy 
constraints affected the Shuttle Programʼs organization cul-
ture, its structure, and the structure of the safety system. The 
three combined to keep NASA on its slippery slope toward 
Challenger  and  Columbia.  NASA  culture  allowed  flying 
with flaws when problems were defined as normal and rou-
tine; the structure of NASAʼs Shuttle Program blocked the 
flow of critical information up the hierarchy, so definitions 
of risk continued unaltered. Finally, a perennially weakened 
safety system, unable to critically analyze and intervene, had 
no choice but to ratify the existing risk assessments on these 
two problems. The following comparison shows that these 
system effects persisted through time, and affected engineer-
ing decisions in the years leading up to both accidents.

The Board found that dangerous aspects of NASAʼs 1986 
culture,  identified  by  the  Rogers  Commission,  remained 
unchanged. The Space Shuttle Program had been built on 
compromises hammered out by the White House and NASA 
headquarters.14 As a result, NASA was transformed from a 
research  and  development  agency  to  more  of  a  business, 
with  schedules,  production  pressures,  deadlines,  and  cost 
efficiency goals elevated to the level of technical innovation 
and  safety  goals.15 The  Rogers  Commission  dedicated  an 
entire chapter of its report to production pressures.16 More-
over, the Rogers Commission, as well as the 1990 Augus-
tine Committee and the 1999 Shuttle Independent Assess-
ment Team, criticized NASA for treating the Shuttle as if it 
were an operational vehicle. Launching on a tight schedule, 
which the agency had pursued as part of its initial bargain 
with  the  White  House,  was  not  the  way  to  operate  what 
was in fact an experimental vehicle. The Board found that 
prior to Columbia, a budget-limited Space Shuttle Program, 
forced again and again to refashion itself into an efficiency 
model because of repeated government cutbacks, was beset 
by these same ills. The harmful effects of schedule pressure 
identified in previous reports had returned.

Prior to both accidents, NASA was scrambling to keep up. 
Not  only  were  schedule  pressures  impacting  the  people 
who  worked  most  closely  with  the  technology  –  techni-
cians, mission operators, flight crews, and vehicle proces-
sors – engineering decisions also were affected.17 For foam 
debris and O-ring erosion, the definition of risk established 
during  the  Flight  Readiness  process  determined  actions 
taken and not taken, but the schedule and shoestring bud-
get  were  equally  influential.  NASA  was  cutting  corners. 
Launches proceeded with incomplete engineering work on 
these flaws. Challenger-era engineers were working on a 
permanent fix for the booster joints while launches contin-
ued.18 After the major foam bipod hit on STS-112, manage-
ment made the deadline for corrective action on the foam 
problem after the next launch, STS-113, and then slipped it 
again until after the flight of STS-107. Delays for flowliner 
and Ball Strut Tie Rod Assembly problems left no margin in 
the schedule between February 2003 and the management-
imposed  February  2004  launch  date  for  the  International 
Space Station Node 2. Available resources – including time 
out of the schedule for research and hardware modifications 
– went to the problems that were designated as serious – 
those  most  likely  to  bring  down  a  Shuttle.  The  NASA 
culture encouraged flying with flaws because the schedule 
could not be held up for routine problems that were not de-
fined as a threat to mission safety.19

The question the Board had to answer was why, since the 
foam debris anomalies went on for so long, had no one rec-
ognized the trend and intervened? The O-ring history prior 
to Challenger had followed the same pattern. This question 
pointed the Boardʼs attention toward the NASA organiza-
tion structure and the structure of its safety system. Safety-
oriented organizations often build in checks and balances 
to identify and monitor signals of potential danger. If these 
checks and balances were in place in the Shuttle Program, 
they  werenʼt  working.  Again,  past  policy  decisions  pro-
duced system effects with implications for both Challenger 
and Columbia.

Prior to Challenger, Shuttle Program structure had hindered 
information flows, leading the Rogers Commission to con-
clude that critical information about technical problems was 
not conveyed effectively through the hierarchy.20 The Space 
Shuttle  Program  had  altered  its  structure  by  outsourcing 
to  contractors,  which  added  to  communication  problems. 
The  Commission  recommended  many  changes  to  remedy 
these problems, and NASA made many of them. However, 
the Board found that those post-Challenger changes were 
undone  over  time  by  management  actions.21  NASA  ad-
ministrators, reacting to government pressures, transferred 
more  functions  and  responsibilities  to  the  private  sector. 
The change was cost-efficient, but personnel cuts reduced 
oversight of contractors at the same time that the agencyʼs 
dependence  upon  contractor  engineering  judgment  in-
creased. When high-risk technology is the product and lives 
are at stake, safety, oversight, and communication flows are 
critical. The Board found that the Shuttle Programʼs normal 
chain  of  command  and  matrix  system  did  not  perform  a 
check-and-balance function on either foam or O-rings. 

The Flight Readiness Review process might have reversed 
the disastrous trend of normalizing O-ring erosion and foam 
debris  hits,  but  it  didnʼt.  In  fact,  the  Rogers  Commission 
found that the Flight Readiness process only affirmed the 
pre-Challenger  engineering  risk  assessments.22  Equally 
troubling,  the  Board  found  that  the  Flight  Readiness  pro-
cess, which is built on consensus verified by signatures of 
all responsible parties, in effect renders no one accountable. 
Although  the  process  was  altered  after  Challenger,  these 
changes did not erase the basic problems that were built into 
the structure of the Flight Readiness Review.23 Managers at 
the top were dependent on engineers at the bottom for their 
engineering analysis and risk assessments. Information was 
lost as engineering risk analyses moved through the process. 
At succeeding stages, management awareness of anomalies, 
and therefore risks, was reduced either because of the need 
to be increasingly brief and concise as all the parts of the 
system  came  together,  or  because  of  the  need  to  produce 
consensus  decisions  at  each  level.  The  Flight  Readiness 
process was designed to assess hardware and take corrective 
actions that would transform known problems into accept-
able flight risks, and that is precisely what it did. The 1986 
House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  concluded 
during its investigation into Challenger that Flight Readi-
ness Reviews had performed exactly as they were designed, 
but that they could not be expected to replace engineering 
analysis, and therefore they “cannot be expected to prevent 
a flight because of a design flaw that Project management 
had already determined an acceptable risk.”24 Those words, 
true for the history of O-ring erosion, also hold true for the 
history of foam debris. 

The last line of defense against errors is usually a safety 
system.  But  the  previous  policy  decisions  by  leaders  de-
scribed  in  Chapter  5  also  impacted  the  safety  structure 
and  contributed  to  both  accidents.  Neither  in  the  O-ring 
erosion nor the foam debris problems did NASAʼs safety 
system  attempt  to  reverse  the  course  of  events.  In  1986, 
the Rogers Commission called it “The Silent Safety Sys-
tem.”25 Pre-Challenger budget shortages resulted in safety 
personnel  cutbacks.  Without  clout  or  independence,  the

safety  personnel  who  remained  were  ineffective.  In  the 
case  of  Columbia,  the  Board  found  the  same  problems 
were reproduced and for an identical reason: when pressed 
for cost reduction, NASA attacked its own safety system. 
The faulty assumption that supported this strategy prior to 
Columbia  was  that  a  reduction  in  safety  staff  would  not 
result in a reduction of safety, because contractors would 
assume  greater  safety  responsibility.  The  effectiveness 
of those remaining staff safety engineers was blocked by 
their dependence on the very Program they were charged 
to supervise. Also, the Board found many safety units with 
unclear  roles  and  responsibilities  that  left  crucial  gaps. 
Post-Challenger NASA still had no systematic procedure 
for identifying and monitoring trends. The Board was sur-
prised at how long it took NASA to put together trend data 
in  response  to  Board  requests  for  information.  Problem 
reporting  and  tracking  systems  were  still  overloaded  or 
underused,  which  undermined  their  very  purpose.  Mul-
tiple job titles disguised the true extent of safety personnel 
shortages. The Board found cases in which the same person 
was occupying more than one safety position – and in one 
instance at least three positions – which compromised any 
possibility of safety organization independence because the 
jobs were established with built-in conflicts of interest. 
8.4  ORGANIZATION, CULTURE, AND
 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

A number of changes to the Space Shuttle Program structure 
made  in  response  to  policy  decisions  had  the  unintended 
effect of perpetuating dangerous aspects of pre-Challenger 
culture and continued the pattern of normalizing things that 
were not supposed to happen. At the same time that NASA 
leaders  were  emphasizing  the  importance  of  safety,  their 
personnel  cutbacks  sent  other  signals.  Streamlining  and 
downsizing,  which  scarcely  go  unnoticed  by  employees, 
convey  a  message  that  efficiency  is  an  important  goal. 
The  Shuttle/Space  Station  partnership  affected  both  pro-
grams.  Working  evenings  and  weekends  just  to  meet  the 
International  Space  Station  Node  2  deadline  sent  a  signal 
to employees that schedule is important. When paired with 
the “faster, better, cheaper” NASA motto of the 1990s and 
cuts that dramatically decreased safety personnel, efficiency 
becomes a strong signal and safety a weak one. This kind of 
doublespeak by top administrators affects peopleʼs decisions 
and actions without them even realizing it.26 

Changes in Space Shuttle Program structure contributed to 
the  accident  in  a  second  important  way.  Despite  the  con-
straints that the agency was under, prior to both accidents 
NASA appeared to be immersed in a culture of invincibility, 
in  stark  contradiction  to  post-accident  reality. The  Rogers 
Commission found a NASA blinded by its “Can-Do” atti-
tude,27 a cultural artifact of the Apollo era that was inappro-
priate in a Space Shuttle Program so strapped by schedule 
pressures and shortages that spare parts had to be cannibal-
ized from one vehicle to launch another.28 This can-do atti-
tude bolstered administratorsʼ belief in an achievable launch 
rate, the belief that they had an operational system, and an 
unwillingness  to  listen  to  outside  experts.  The Aerospace 
Safety  and  Advisory  Panel  in  a  1985  report  told  NASA 
that the vehicle was not operational and NASA should stop 

treating it as if it were.29 The Board found that even after the 
loss of Challenger, NASA was guilty of treating an experi-
mental vehicle as if it were operational and of not listening 
to outside experts. In a repeat of the pre-Challenger warn-
ing, the 1999 Shuttle Independent Assessment Team report 
reiterated that “the Shuttle was not an ʻoperationalʼ vehicle 
in the usual meaning of the term.”30 Engineers and program 
planners  were  also  affected  by  “Can-Do,”  which,  when 
taken too far, can create a reluctance to say that something 
cannot be done.

How could the lessons of Challenger have been forgotten 
so  quickly? Again,  history  was  a  factor.  First,  if  success 
is  measured  by  launches  and  landings,31  the  machine  ap-
peared to be working successfully prior to both accidents. 
Challenger was the 25th launch. Seventeen years and 87 
missions passed without major incident. Second, previous 
policy decisions again had an impact. NASAʼs Apollo-era 
research and development culture and its prized deference 
to  the  technical  expertise  of  its  working  engineers  was 
overridden  in  the  Space  Shuttle  era  by  “bureaucratic  ac-
countability” – an allegiance to hierarchy, procedure, and 
following the chain of command.32 Prior to Challenger, the 
can-do culture was a result not just of years of apparently 
successful launches, but of the cultural belief that the Shut-
tle  Programʼs  many  structures,  rigorous  procedures,  and 
detailed system of rules were responsible for those success-
es.33 The Board noted that the pre-Challenger layers of pro-
cesses, boards, and panels that had produced a false sense of 
confidence in the system and its level of safety returned in 
full force prior to Columbia. NASA made many changes to 
the Space Shuttle Program structure after Challenger. The 
fact that many changes had been made supported a belief in 
the safety of the system, the invincibility of organizational 
and technical systems, and ultimately, a sense that the foam 
problem was understood.
8.5  HISTORY AS CAUSE: TWO ACCIDENTS

Risk, uncertainty, and history came together when unprec-
edented  circumstances  arose  prior  to  both  accidents.  For 
Challenger, the weather prediction for launch time the next 
day was for cold temperatures that were out of the engineer-
ing experience base. For Columbia, a large foam hit – also 
outside the experience base – was discovered after launch. 
For  the  first  case,  all  the  discussion  was  pre-launch;  for 
the  second,  it  was  post-launch.  This  initial  difference  de-
termined the shape these two decision sequences took, the 
number of people who had information about the problem, 
and the locations of the involved parties.

For  Challenger,  engineers  at  Morton-Thiokol,34  the  Solid 
Rocket  Motor  contractor  in  Utah,  were  concerned  about 
the  effect  of  the  unprecedented  cold  temperatures  on  the 
rubber  O-rings.35  Because  launch  was  scheduled  for  the 
next morning, the new condition required a reassessment of 
the engineering analysis presented at the Flight Readiness 
Review  two  weeks  prior. A  teleconference  began  at  8:45 
p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) that included 34 people 
in three locations: Morton-Thiokol in Utah, Marshall, and 
Kennedy. Thiokol engineers were recommending a launch 
delay. A reconsideration of a Flight Readiness Review risk

assessment the night before a launch was as unprecedented 
as the predicted cold temperatures. With no ground rules or 
procedures to guide their discussion, the participants auto-
matically  reverted  to  the  centralized,  hierarchical,  tightly 
structured, and procedure-bound model used in Flight Read-
iness Reviews. The entire discussion and decision to launch 
began and ended with this group of 34 engineers. The phone 
conference linking them together concluded at 11:15 p.m. 
EST after a decision to accept the risk and fly.

For Columbia, information about the foam debris hit was 
widely  distributed  the  day  after  launch. Time  allowed  for 
videos of the strike, initial assessments of the size and speed 
of the foam, and the approximate location of the impact to 
be dispersed throughout the agency. This was the first de-
bris  impact  of  this  magnitude.  Engineers  at  the  Marshall, 
Johnson,  Kennedy,  and  Langley  centers  showed  initiative 
and jumped on the problem without direction from above. 
Working groups and e-mail groups formed spontaneously. 
The size of Johnsonʼs Debris Assessment Team alone neared 
and in some instances exceeded the total number of partici-
pants in the 1986 Challenger teleconference. Rather than a 
tightly constructed exchange of information completed in a 
few hours, time allowed for the development of ideas and 
free-wheeling discussion among the engineering ranks. The 
early post-launch discussion among engineers and all later 
decision-making at management levels were decentralized, 
loosely organized, and with little form. While the spontane-
ous and decentralized exchanging of information was evi-
dence that NASAʼs original technical culture was alive and 
well, the diffuse form and lack of structure in the rest of the 
proceedings would have several negative consequences. 

In  both  situations,  all  new  information  was  weighed  and 
interpreted against past experience. Formal categories and 
cultural beliefs provide a consistent frame of reference in 
which  people  view  and  interpret  information  and  experi-
ences.36 Pre-existing definitions of risk shaped the actions 
taken and not taken. Worried engineers in 1986 and again 
in 2003 found it impossible to reverse the Flight Readiness 
Review risk assessments that foam and O-rings did not pose 
safety-of-flight concerns. These engineers could not prove 
that foam strikes and cold temperatures were unsafe, even 
though  the  previous  analyses  that  declared  them  safe  had 
been  incomplete  and  were  based  on  insufficient  data  and 
testing.  Engineersʼ  failed  attempts  were  not  just  a  matter 
of psychological frames and interpretations. The obstacles 
these  engineers  faced  were  political  and  organizational. 
They  were  rooted  in  NASA  history  and  the  decisions  of 
leaders  that  had  altered  NASA  culture,  structure,  and  the 
structure of the safety system and affected the social con-
text of decision-making for both accidents. In the following 
comparison of these critical decision scenarios for Columbia 
and Challenger, the systemic problems in the NASA orga-
nization are in italics, with the system effects on decision-
making following.

NASA  had  conflicting  goals  of  cost,  schedule,  and  safety. 
Safety lost out as the mandates of an “operational system” 
increased the schedule pressure. Scarce resources went to 
problems that were defined as more serious, rather than to 
foam strikes or O-ring erosion. 

In  both  situations,  upper-level  managers  and  engineering 
teams  working  the  O-ring  and  foam  strike  problems  held 
opposing definitions of risk. This was demonstrated imme-
diately, as engineers reacted with urgency to the immediate 
safety  implications:  Thiokol  engineers  scrambled  to  put 
together an engineering assessment for the teleconference, 
Langley  Research  Center  engineers  initiated  simulations 
of  landings  that  were  run  after  hours  at  Ames  Research 
Center, and Boeing analysts worked through the weekend 
on the debris impact analysis. But key managers were re-
sponding to additional demands of cost and schedule, which 
competed  with  their  safety  concerns.  NASAʼs  conflicting 
goals put engineers at a disadvantage before these new situ-
ations even arose. In neither case did they have good data 
as a basis for decision-making. Because both problems had 
been previously normalized, resources sufficient for testing 
or hardware were not dedicated. The Space Shuttle Program 
had not produced good data on the correlation between cold 
temperature and O-ring resilience or good data on the poten-
tial effect of bipod ramp foam debris hits.37 

Cultural beliefs about the low risk O-rings and foam debris 
posed, backed by years of Flight Readiness Review deci-
sions  and  successful  missions,  provided  a  frame  of  refer-
ence against which the engineering analyses were judged. 
When confronted with the engineering risk assessments, top 
Shuttle Program managers held to the previous Flight Readi-
ness Review assessments. In the Challenger teleconference, 
where engineers were recommending that NASA delay the 
launch, the Marshall Solid Rocket Booster Project manager, 
Lawrence  Mulloy,  repeatedly  challenged  the  contractorʼs 
risk  assessment  and  restated  Thiokolʼs  engineering  ratio-
nale  for  previous  flights.38  STS-107  Mission  Management 
Team Chair Linda Ham made many statements in meetings 
reiterating her understanding that foam was a maintenance 
problem and a turnaround issue, not a safety-of-flight issue.

The effects of working as a manager in a culture with a cost/
efficiency/safety conflict showed in managerial responses. In 
both cases, managersʼ techniques focused on the information 
that tended to support the expected or desired result at that 
time. In both cases, believing the safety of the mission was 
not at risk, managers drew conclusions that minimized the 
risk  of  delay.39 At  one  point,  Marshallʼs  Mulloy,  believing 
in  the  previous  Flight  Readiness  Review  assessments,  un-
convinced by the engineering analysis, and concerned about 
the schedule implications of the 53-degree temperature limit 
on launch the engineers proposed, said, “My God, Thiokol, 
when do you want me to launch, next April?”40 Reflecting the 
overall goal of keeping to the Node 2 launch schedule, Hamʼs 
priority was to avoid the delay of STS–114, the next mis-
sion after STS-107. Ham was slated as Manager of Launch 
Integration for STS-114 – a dual role promoting a conflict of 
interest and a single-point failure, a situation that should be 
avoided in all organizational as well as technical systems. 

NASAʼs culture of bureaucratic accountability emphasized 
chain of command, procedure, following the rules, and go-
ing by the book. While rules and procedures were essential 
for coordination, they had an unintended but negative effect. 
Allegiance to hierarchy and procedure had replaced defer-
ence to NASA engineersʼ technical expertise.

In both cases, engineers initially presented concerns as well 
as possible solutions – a request for images, a recommenda-
tion  to  place  temperature  constraints  on  launch.  Manage-
ment did not listen to what their engineers were telling them. 
Instead, rules and procedures took priority. For Columbia, 
program managers turned off the Kennedy engineersʼ initial 
request for Department of Defense imagery, with apologies 
to Defense Department representatives for not having fol-
lowed “proper channels.” In addition, NASA administrators 
asked  for  and  promised  corrective  action  to  prevent  such 
a violation of protocol from recurring. Debris Assessment 
Team analysts at Johnson were asked by managers to dem-
onstrate a “mandatory need” for their imagery request, but 
were not told how to do that. Both Challenger and Columbia 
engineering teams were held to the usual quantitative stan-
dard of proof. But it was a reverse of the usual circumstance: 
instead of having to prove it was safe to fly, they were asked 
to prove that it was unsafe to fly. 

In the  Challenger teleconference, a key engineering chart 
presented a qualitative argument about the relationship be-
tween cold temperatures and O-ring erosion that engineers 
were asked to prove. Thiokolʼs Roger Boisjoly said, “I had 
no data to quantify it. But I did say I knew it was away from 
goodness in the current data base.”41 Similarly, the Debris 
Assessment Team was asked to prove that the foam hit was 
a threat to flight safety, a determination that only the imag-
ery they were requesting could help them make. Ignored by 
management  was  the  qualitative  data  that  the  engineering 
teams did have: both instances were outside the experience 
base. In stark contrast to the requirement that engineers ad-
here to protocol and hierarchy was managementʼs failure to 
apply this criterion to their own activities. The Mission Man-
agement Team did not meet on a regular schedule during the 
mission, proceeded in a loose format that allowed informal 
influence and status differences to shape their decisions, and 
allowed unchallenged opinions and assumptions to prevail, 
all the while holding the engineers who were making risk 
assessments to higher standards. In highly uncertain circum-
stances, when lives were immediately at risk, management 
failed to defer to its engineers and failed to recognize that 
different data standards – qualitative, subjective, and intui-
tive – and different processes – democratic rather than proto-
col and chain of command – were more appropriate. 

The organizational structure and hierarchy blocked effective 
communication  of  technical  problems.  Signals  were  over-
looked,  people  were  silenced,  and  useful  information  and 
dissenting views on technical issues did not surface at higher 
levels. What was communicated to parts of the organization 
was that O-ring erosion and foam debris were not problems. 

Structure and hierarchy represent power and status. For both 
Challenger and Columbia, employeesʼ positions in the orga-
nization determined the weight given to their information, 
by their own judgment and in the eyes of others. As a result, 
many signals of danger were missed. Relevant information 
that could have altered the course of events was available 
but was not presented.

Early in the Challenger teleconference, some engineers who 
had important information did not speak up. They did not 

define themselves as qualified because of their position: they 
were not in an appropriate specialization, had not recently 
worked the O-ring problem, or did not have access to the 
“good data” that they assumed others more involved in key 
discussions  would  have.42  Geographic  locations  also  re-
sulted in missing signals. At one point, in light of Marshallʼs 
objections, Thiokol managers in Utah requested an “off-line 
caucus”  to  discuss  their  data.  No  consensus  was  reached, 
so  a  “management  risk  decision”  was  made.  Managers 
voted and engineers did not. Thiokol managers came back 
on line, saying they had reversed their earlier NO-GO rec-
ommendation, decided to accept risk, and would send new 
engineering charts to back their reversal. When a Marshall 
administrator asked, “Does anyone have anything to add to 
this?,” no one spoke. Engineers at Thiokol who still objected 
to the decision later testified that they were intimidated by 
management  authority,  were  accustomed  to  turning  their 
analysis over to managers and letting them decide, and did 
not have the quantitative data that would empower them to 
object further.43 

the  more  decentralized  decision  process  prior 

In 
to 
Columbiaʼs re-entry, structure and hierarchy again were re-
sponsible for an absence of signals. The initial request for 
imagery came from the “low status” Kennedy Space Center, 
bypassed the Mission Management Team, and went directly 
to the Department of Defense separate from the all-power-
ful Shuttle Program. By using the Engineering Directorate 
avenue to request imagery, the Debris Assessment Team was 
working at the margins of the hierarchy. But some signals 
were missing even when engineers traversed the appropriate 
channels. The Mission Management Team Chairʼs position in 
the hierarchy governed what information she would or would 
not receive. Information was lost as it traveled up the hierar-
chy. A demoralized Debris Assessment Team did not include 
a slide about the need for better imagery in their presentation 
to the Mission Evaluation Room. Their presentation included 
the Crater analysis, which they reported as incomplete and 
uncertain. However, the Mission Evaluation Room manager 
perceived the Boeing analysis as rigorous and quantitative. 
The choice of headings, arrangement of information, and size 
of bullets on the key chart served to highlight what manage-
ment  already  believed.  The  uncertainties  and  assumptions 
that  signaled  danger  dropped  out  of  the  information  chain 
when the Mission Evaluation Room manager condensed the 
Debris Assessment Teamʼs formal presentation to an infor-
mal verbal brief at the Mission Management Team meeting. 

As what the Board calls an “informal chain of command” 
began to shape STS-107ʼs outcome, location in the struc-
ture  empowered  some  to  speak  and  silenced  others.  For 
example, a Thermal Protection System tile expert, who was 
a member of the Debris Assessment Team but had an office 
in the more prestigious Shuttle Program, used his personal 
network to shape the Mission Management Team view and 
snuff out dissent. The informal hierarchy among and within 
Centers was also influential. Early identifications of prob-
lems by Marshall and Kennedy may have contributed to the 
Johnson-based Mission Management Teamʼs indifference to 
concerns about the foam strike. The engineers and managers 
circulating e-mails at Langley were peripheral to the Shuttle 
Program, not structurally connected to the proceedings, and

therefore  of  lower  status.  When  asked  in  a  post-accident 
press  conference  why  they  didnʼt  voice  their  concerns  to 
Shuttle  Program  management,  the  Langley  engineers  said 
that people “need to stick to their expertise.”44 Status mat-
tered.  In  its  absence,  numbers  were  the  great  equalizer. 
One  striking  exception:  the  Debris Assessment  Team  tile 
expert was so influential that his word was taken as gospel, 
though  he  lacked  the  requisite  expertise,  data,  or  analysis 
to evaluate damage to RCC. For those with lesser standing, 
the requirement for data was stringent and inhibiting, which 
resulted  in  information  that  warned  of  danger  not  being 
passed up the chain. As in the teleconference, Debris As-
sessment Team engineers did not speak up when the Mission 
Management Team Chair asked if anyone else had anything 
to say. Not only did they not have the numbers, they also 
were intimidated by the Mission Management Team Chairʼs 
position in the hierarchy and the conclusions she had already 
made. Debris Assessment Team members signed off on the 
Crater analysis, even though they had trouble understanding 
it. They still wanted images of Columbiaʼs left wing.

In neither impending crisis did management recognize how 
structure  and  hierarchy  can  silence  employees  and  follow 
through by polling participants, soliciting dissenting opin-
ions,  or  bringing  in  outsiders  who  might  have  a  different 
perspective or useful information. In perhaps the ultimate 
example  of  engineering  concerns  not  making  their  way 
upstream, Challenger astronauts were told that the cold tem-
perature was not a problem, and Columbia astronauts were 
told that the foam strike was not a problem.

NASA structure changed as roles and responsibilities were 
transferred to contractors, which increased the dependence 
on the private sector for safety functions and risk assess-
ment while simultaneously reducing the in-house capability 
to spot safety issues. 

A critical turning point in both decisions hung on the discus-
sion of contractor risk assessments. Although both Thiokol 
and  Boeing  engineering  assessments  were  replete  with 
uncertainties,  NASA  ultimately  accepted  each.  Thiokolʼs 
initial  recommendation  against  the  launch  of  Challenger 
was at first criticized by Marshall as flawed and unaccept-
able. Thiokol  was  recommending  an  unheard-of  delay  on 
the eve of a launch, with schedule ramifications and NASA-
contractor relationship repercussions. In the Thiokol off-line 
caucus, a senior vice president who seldom participated in 
these  engineering  discussions  championed  the  Marshall 
engineering rationale for flight. When he told the managers 
present to “Take off your engineering hat and put on your 
management  hat,”  they  reversed  the  position  their  own 
engineers  had  taken.45  Marshall  engineers  then  accepted 
this assessment, deferring to the expertise of the contractor. 
NASA was dependent on Thiokol for the risk assessment, 
but  the  decision  process  was  affected  by  the  contractorʼs 
dependence on NASA. Not willing to be responsible for a 
delay, and swayed by the strength of Marshallʼs argument, 
the  contractor  did  not  act  in  the  best  interests  of  safety. 
Boeingʼs  Crater  analysis  was  performed  in  the  context  of 
the  Debris  Assessment  Team,  which  was  a  collaborative 
effort  that  included  Johnson,  United  Space  Alliance,  and 
Boeing. In this case, the decision process was also affected 

by NASAʼs dependence on the contractor. Unfamiliar with 
Crater, NASA engineers and managers had to rely on Boeing 
for interpretation and analysis, and did not have the train-
ing necessary to evaluate the results. They accepted Boeing 
engineersʼ use of Crater to model a debris impact 400 times 
outside validated limits.

NASAʼs  safety  system  lacked  the  resources,  independence, 
personnel, and authority to successfully apply alternate per-
spectives to developing problems. Overlapping roles and re-
sponsibilities across multiple safety offices also undermined 
the possibility of a reliable system of checks and balances.

NASAʼs “Silent Safety System” did nothing to alter the deci-
sion-making that immediately preceded both accidents. No 
safety  representatives  were  present  during  the  Challenger 
teleconference – no one even thought to call them.46 In the 
case  of  Columbia,  safety  representatives  were  present  at 
Mission Evaluation Room, Mission Management Team, and 
Debris Assessment  Team  meetings.  However,  rather  than 
critically question or actively participate in the analysis, the 
safety representatives simply listened and concurred.
8.6  CHANGING NASAʼS ORGANIZATIONAL 

SYSTEM

The  echoes  of  Challenger  in  Columbia  identified  in  this 
chapter have serious implications. These repeating patterns 
mean that flawed practices embedded in NASAʼs organiza-
tional system continued for 20 years and made substantial 
contributions  to  both  accidents.  The  Columbia  Accident 
Investigation Board noted the same problems as the Rog-
ers  Commission. An  organization  system  failure  calls  for 
corrective  measures  that  address  all  relevant  levels  of  the 
organization, but the Boardʼs investigation shows that for all 
its  cutting-edge  technologies,  “diving-catch”  rescues,  and 
imaginative plans for the technology and the future of space 
exploration, NASA has shown very little understanding of 
the inner workings of its own organization.

NASA  managers  believed  that  the  agency  had  a  strong 
safety  culture,  but  the  Board  found  that  the  agency  had 
the  same  conflicting  goals  that  it  did  before  Challenger, 
when  schedule  concerns,  production  pressure,  cost-cut-
ting and a drive for ever-greater efficiency – all the signs 
of an “operational” enterprise – had eroded NASAʼs abil-
ity to assure mission safety. The belief in a safety culture 
has even less credibility in light of repeated cuts of safety 
personnel and budgets – also conditions that existed before 
Challenger. NASA managers stated confidently that every-
one was encouraged to speak up about safety issues and that 
the agency was responsive to those concerns, but the Board 
found evidence to the contrary in the responses to the Debris 
Assessment Teamʼs request for imagery, to the initiation of 
the imagery request from Kennedy Space Center, and to the 
“we  were  just  ʻwhat-iffingʼ”  e-mail  concerns  that  did  not 
reach the Mission Management Team. NASAʼs bureaucratic 
structure  kept  important  information  from  reaching  engi-
neers and managers alike. The same NASA whose engineers 
showed  initiative  and  a  solid  working  knowledge  of  how 
to get things done fast had a managerial culture with an al-
legiance to bureaucracy and cost-efficiency that squelched

the engineersʼ efforts. When it came to managersʼ own ac-
tions, however, a different set of rules prevailed. The Board 
found  that  Mission  Management  Team  decision-making 
operated  outside  the  rules  even  as  it  held  its  engineers  to 
a stifling protocol. Management was not able to recognize 
that in unprecedented conditions, when lives are on the line, 
flexibility and democratic process should take priority over 
bureaucratic response.47 

During the Columbia investigation, the Board consistently 
searched for causal principles that would explain both the 
technical  and  organizational  system  failures.  These  prin-
ciples were needed to explain Columbia and its echoes of 
Challenger. They were also necessary to provide guidance 
for NASA. The Boardʼs analysis of organizational causes in 
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 supports the following principles that 
should  govern  the  changes  in  the  agencyʼs  organizational 
system.  The  Boardʼs  specific  recommendations,  based  on 
these principles, are presented in Part Three.

Leaders create culture. It is their responsibility to change 
it.  Top  administrators  must  take  responsibility  for  risk, 
failure,  and  safety  by  remaining  alert  to  the  effects  their 
decisions have on the system. Leaders are responsible for 
establishing the conditions that lead to their subordinatesʼ 
successes  or  failures. The  past  decisions  of  national lead-
ers – the White House, Congress, and NASA Headquarters 
– set the Columbia accident in motion by creating resource 
and schedule strains that compromised the principles of a 
high-risk technology organization. The measure of NASAʼs 
success became how much costs were reduced and how ef-
ficiently the schedule was met. But the Space Shuttle is not 
now, nor has it ever been, an operational vehicle. We cannot 
explore  space  on  a  fixed-cost  basis.  Nevertheless,  due  to 
International Space Station needs and scientific experiments 
that require particular timing and orbits, the Space Shuttle 
Program  seems  likely  to  continue  to  be  schedule-driven. 
National leadership needs to recognize that NASA must fly 
only when it is ready. As the White House, Congress, and 
NASA Headquarters plan the future of human space flight, 
the goals and the resources required to achieve them safely 
must be aligned. 

Changes  in  organizational  structure  should  be  made  only 
with careful consideration of their effect on the system and 
their possible unintended consequences. Changes that make 
the organization more complex may create new ways that it 
can fail.48 When changes are put in place, the risk of error 
initially increases, as old ways of doing things compete with 
new. Institutional memory is lost as personnel and records 
are moved and replaced. Changing the structure of organi-
zations is complicated by external political and budgetary 
constraints, the inability of leaders to conceive of the full 
ramifications of their actions, the vested interests of insiders, 
and the failure to learn from the past.49 

Nonetheless, changes must be made. The Shuttle Programʼs 
structure is a source of problems, not just because of the 
way  it  impedes  the  flow  of  information,  but  because  it 
has had effects on the culture that contradict safety goals. 
NASAʼs blind spot is it believes it has a strong safety cul-
ture. Program history shows that the loss of a truly indepen-

dent, robust capability to protect the systemʼs fundamental 
requirements  and  specifications  inevitably  compromised 
those  requirements,  and  therefore  increased  risk.  The 
Shuttle Programʼs structure created power distributions that 
need  new  structuring,  rules,  and  management  training  to 
restore deference to technical experts, empower engineers 
to get resources they need, and allow safety concerns to be 
freely aired.

Strategies must increase the clarity, strength, and presence 
of signals that challenge assumptions about risk. Twice in 
NASA history, the agency embarked on a slippery slope that 
resulted in catastrophe. Each decision, taken by itself, seemed 
correct, routine, and indeed, insignificant and unremarkable. 
Yet  in  retrospect,  the  cumulative  effect  was  stunning.  In 
both pre-accident periods, events unfolded over a long time 
and in small increments rather than in sudden and dramatic 
occurrences.  NASAʼs  challenge  is  to  design  systems  that 
maximize the clarity of signals, amplify weak signals so they 
can be tracked, and account for missing signals. For both ac-
cidents there were moments when management definitions 
of risk might have been reversed were it not for the many 
missing signals – an absence of trend analysis, imagery data 
not obtained, concerns not voiced, information overlooked 
or dropped from briefings. A safety team must have equal 
and  independent  representation  so  that  managers  are  not 
again lulled into complacency by shifting definitions of risk. 
It is obvious but worth acknowledging that people who are 
marginal  and  powerless  in  organizations  may  have  useful 
information or opinions that they donʼt express. Even when 
these people are encouraged to speak, they find it intimidat-
ing to contradict a leaderʼs strategy or a group consensus. 
Extra effort must be made to contribute all relevant informa-
tion to discussions of risk. These strategies are important for 
all safety aspects, but especially necessary for ill-structured 
problems like O-rings and foam debris. Because ill-structured 
problems are less visible and therefore invite the normaliza-
tion of deviance, they may be the most risky of all.

ary 28, 1986. The Orbiter would be destroyed 73 seconds later.

49  Typically,  after  a  public  failure,  the  responsible  organization  makes 
safety the priority. They sink resources into discovering what went wrong 
and lessons learned are on everyoneʼs minds. A boost in resources goes 
to safety to build on those lessons in order to prevent another failure. 
But  concentrating  on  rebuilding,  repair,  and  safety  takes  energy  and 
resources  from  other  goals.  As  the  crisis  ebbs  and  normal  functioning 
returns,  institutional  memory  grows  short.  The  tendency  is  then  to 
backslide,  as  external  pressures  force  a  return  to  operating  goals.

Part Three

A Look Ahead

When itʼs dark, the stars come out … The same is true 
with people. When the tragedies of life turn a bright day 
into a frightening night, Godʼs stars come out and these 
stars are families who say although we grieve deeply 
as do the families of Apollo 1 and Challenger before 
us,  the  bold  exploration  of  space  must  go  on.  These 
stars are the leaders in Government and in NASA who 
will not let the vision die. These stars are the next gen-
eration of astronauts, who like the prophets of old said, 
“Here am I, send me.”

Ceremony at the National Cathedral, February 6, 2003

on the long-term future of human space flight, the Board ad-
dresses the need for a national vision to direct the design of 
a new Space Transportation System.

Chapter  10  contains  additional  recommendations  and  the 
significant “look ahead” observations the Board made in the 
course of this investigation that were not directly related to 
the accident, but could be viewed as “weak signals” of fu-
ture problems. The observations may be indications of seri-
ous future problems and must be addressed by NASA.

Chapter  11  contains  the  recommendations  made  in  Parts 
One, Two and Three, all issued with the resolve to continue 
human space flight.

As this report ends, the Board wants to recognize the out-
standing  people  in  NASA.  We  have  been  impressed  with 
their  diligence,  commitment,  and  professionalism  as  the 
agency has been working tirelessly to help the Board com-
plete this report. While mistakes did lead to the accident, and 
we found that organizational and cultural constraints have 
worked  against  safety  margins,  the  NASA  family  should 
nonetheless continue to take great pride in their legacy and 
ongoing accomplishments. As we look ahead, the Board sin-
cerely hopes this report will aid NASA in safely getting back 
to human space flight.

In Part Three the Board presents its views and recommenda-
tions for the steps needed to achieve that goal, of continuing 
our exploration of space, in a manner with improved safety.

Chapter 9 discusses the near-term, mid-term and long-term 
implications for the future of human space flight. For the 
near term, NASA should submit to the Return-to-Flight Task 
Force  a  plan  for  implementing  the  return-to-flight  recom-
mendations. For the mid-term, the agency should focus on: 
the remaining Part One recommendations, the Part Two rec-
ommendations for organizational and cultural changes, and 
the Part Three recommendation for recertifying the Shuttle 
for use to 2020 or beyond. In setting the stage for a debate

CHAPTER 9

Implications for the
Future of Human Space Flight

And while many memorials will be built to honor Co-
lumbiaʼs crew, their greatest memorial will be a vibrant 
space program with new missions carried out by a new 
generation of brave explorers.

  –  Remarks  by  Vice  President  Richard  B.  Cheney,  Memorial 
Ceremony at the National Cathedral, February 6, 2003

The report up to this point has been a look backward: a single 
accident with multiple causes, both physical and organiza-
tional. In this chapter, the Board looks to the future. We take 
the insights gained in investigating the loss of Columbia and 
her  crew  and  seek  to  apply  them  to  this  nationʼs  continu-
ing journey into space. We divide our discussion into three 
timeframes: 1) short-term, NASAʼs return to flight after the 
Columbia accident; 2) mid-term, what is needed to continue 
flying the Shuttle fleet until a replacement means for human 
access to space and for other Shuttle capabilities is available; 
and 3) long-term, future directions for the U.S. in space. The 
objective in each case is for this country to maintain a human 
presence in space, but with enhanced safety of flight. 

In  this  report  we  have  documented  numerous  indications 
that NASAʼs safety performance has been lacking. But even 
correcting all those shortcomings, it should be understood, 
will not eliminate risk. All flight entails some measure of 
risk, and this has been the case since before the days of the 
Wright  Brothers.  Furthermore,  the  risk  is  not  distributed 
evenly over the course of the flight. It is greater by far at the 
beginning and end than during the middle.

This concentration of risk at the endpoints of flight is particu-
larly true for crew-carrying space missions. The Shuttle Pro-
gram has now suffered two accidents, one just over a minute 
after takeoff and the other about 16 minutes before landing. 
The laws of physics make it extraordinarily difficult to reach 
Earth orbit and return safely. Using existing technology, or-
bital flight is accomplished only by harnessing a chemical 
reaction  that  converts  vast  amounts  of  stored  energy  into 

speed. There  is  great  risk  in  placing  human  beings  atop  a 
machine  that  stores  and  then  burns  millions  of  pounds  of 
dangerous propellants. Equally risky is having humans then 
ride the machine back to Earth while it dissipates the orbital 
speed by converting the energy into heat, much like a meteor 
entering Earthʼs atmosphere. No alternatives to this pathway 
to space are available or even on the horizon, so we must 
set our sights on managing this risky process using the most 
advanced and versatile techniques at our disposal.

Because of the dangers of ascent and re-entry, because of 
the  hostility  of  the  space  environment,  and  because  we 
are still relative newcomers to this realm, operation of the 
Shuttle  and  indeed  all  human  spaceflight  must  be  viewed 
as  a  developmental  activity.  It  is  still  far  from  a  routine, 
operational undertaking. Throughout the Columbia accident 
investigation, the Board has commented on the widespread 
but erroneous perception of the Space Shuttle as somehow 
comparable to civil or military air transport. They are not 
comparable; the inherent risks of spaceflight are vastly high-
er, and our experience level with spaceflight is vastly lower. 
If Shuttle operations came to be viewed as routine, it was, at 
least in part, thanks to the skill and dedication of those in-
volved in the program. They have made it look easy, though 
in fact it never was. The Board urges NASA leadership, the 
architects of U.S. space policy, and the American people to 
adopt a realistic understanding of the risks and rewards of 
venturing into space.
9.1  NEAR-TERM: RETURN TO FLIGHT

The Board supports return to flight for the Space Shuttle at 
the earliest date consistent with an overriding consideration: 
safety. The recognition of human spaceflight as a develop-
mental activity requires a shift in focus from operations and 
meeting schedules to a concern for the risks involved. Nec-
essary measures include:

•  Identifying  risks  by  looking  relentlessly  for  the  next 
eroding O-ring, the next falling foam; obtaining better 
data, analyzing and spotting trends.

•  Mitigating  risks  by  stopping  the  failure  at  its  source; 
when a failure does occur, improving the ability to tol-
erate it; repairing the damage on a timely basis.

•  Decoupling unforeseen events from the loss of crew and 

vehicle.

•  Exploring all options for survival, such as provisions for 

crew escape systems and safe havens.

•  Barring unwarranted departures from design standards, 
and adjusting standards only under the most rigorous, 
safety-driven process.

The Board has recommended improvements that are needed 
before the Shuttle Program returns to flight, as well as other 
measures to be adopted over the longer term – what might be 
considered “continuing to fly” recommendations. To ensure 
implementation of these longer-term recommendations, the 
Board makes the following recommendation, which should 
be included in the requirements for return-to-flight:

R9.1-1 

Prepare a detailed plan for defining, establishing, 
transitioning, and implementing an independent 
Technical  Engineering  Authority,  independent 
safety program, and a reorganized Space Shuttle 
Integration Office as described in R7.5-1, R7.5-
2, and R7.5-3. In addition, NASA should submit 
annual reports to Congress, as part of the budget 
review  process,  on  its  implementation  activi-
ties. 

The complete list of the Boardʼs recommendations can be 
found in Chapter 11.

9.2  MID-TERM: CONTINUING TO FLY

It is the view of the Board that the present Shuttle is not 
inherently  unsafe.  However,  the  observations  and  recom-
mendations  in  this  report  are  needed  to  make  the  vehicle 
safe enough to operate in the coming years. In order to con-
tinue operating the Shuttle for another decade or even more, 
which the Human Space Flight Program may find necessary, 
these significant measures must be taken: 

•  Implement all the recommendations listed in Part One 
of this report that were not already accomplished as part 
of the return-to-flight reforms.

•  Institute  all  the  organizational  and  cultural  changes 

called for in Part Two of this report.

•  Undertake  complete  recertification  of  the  Shuttle,  as 

detailed in the discussion and recommendation below.

The urgency of these recommendations derives, at least in 
part, from the likely pattern of what is to come. In the near 
term, the recent memory of the Columbia accident will mo-
tivate the entire NASA organization to scrupulous attention 
to  detail  and  vigorous  efforts  to  resolve  elusive  technical 
problems. That energy will inevitably dissipate over time. 
This decline in vigilance is a characteristic of many large 
organizations, and it has been demonstrated in NASAʼs own 
history. As reported in Part Two of this report, the Human 
Space Flight Program has at times compromised safety be-
cause of its organizational problems and cultural traits. That 
is the reason, in order to prevent the return of bad habits over 
time,  that  the  Board  makes  the  recommendations  in  Part 
Two calling for changes in the organization and culture of 
the Human Space Flight Program. These changes will take 
more  time  and  effort  than  would  be  reasonable  to  expect 
prior to return to flight.

Through its recommendations in Part Two, the Board has 
urged that NASAʼs Human Space Flight Program adopt the 
characteristics  observed  in  high-reliability  organizations. 
One is separating technical authority from the functions of 
managing  schedules  and  cost. Another  is  an  independent 
Safety and Mission Assurance organization. The third is the 
capability  for  effective  systems  integration.  Perhaps  even 
more challenging than these organizational changes are the 
cultural  changes  required. Within  NASA,  the  cultural  im-
pediments to safe and effective Shuttle operations are real 
and  substantial,  as  documented  extensively  in  this  report. 
The Boardʼs view is that cultural problems are unlikely to 
be corrected without top-level leadership. Such leadership 
will  have  to  rid  the  system  of  practices  and  patterns  that 
have been validated simply because they have been around 
so long. Examples include: the tendency to keep knowledge 
of problems contained within a Center or program; making 
technical decisions without in-depth, peer-reviewed techni-
cal analysis; and an unofficial hierarchy or caste system cre-
ated by placing excessive power in one office. Such factors 
interfere with open communication, impede the sharing of 
lessons learned, cause duplication and unnecessary expen-
diture  of  resources,  prompt  resistance  to  external  advice, 
and create a burden for managers, among other undesirable 
outcomes.  Collectively,  these  undesirable  characteristics 
threaten safety.

Unlike return-to-flight recommendations, the Boardʼs man-
agement  and  cultural  recommendations  will  take  longer 
to  implement,  and  the  responses  must  be  fine-tuned  and 
adjusted during implementation. The question of how to fol-
low up on NASAʼs implementation of these more subtle, but 
equally  important  recommendations  remains  unanswered. 
The  Board  is  aware  that  response  to  these  recommenda-
tions  will  be  difficult  to  initiate,  and  they  will  encounter 
some degree of institutional resistance. Nevertheless, in the 
Boardʼs view, they are so critical to safer operation of the 
Shuttle fleet that they must be carried out completely. Since 
NASA  is  an  independent  agency  answerable  only  to  the 
White House and Congress, the ultimate responsibility for 
enforcement  of  the  recommended  corrective  actions  must 
reside with those governmental authorities. 

Recertification
 
Recertification is a process to ensure flight safety when a 
vehicleʼs actual utilization exceeds its original design life; 
such a baseline examination is essential to certify that ve-
hicle for continued use, in the case of the Shuttle to 2020 
and possibly beyond. This report addresses recertification as 
a mid-term issue. 

Measured  by  their  20  or  more  missions  per  Orbiter,  the 
Shuttle fleet is young, but by chronological age – 10 to 20 
years each – it is old. The Boardʼs discovery of mass loss in 
RCC panels, the deferral of investigation into signs of metal 
corrosion, and the deferral of upgrades all strongly suggest 
that a policy is needed requiring a complete recertification 
of the Space Shuttle. This recertification must be rigorous 
and  comprehensive  at  every  level  (i.e.,  material,  compo-
nent, subsystem, and system); the higher the level, the more 
critical the integration of lower-level components. A post-
Challenger, 10-year review was conducted, but it lacked this 
kind of rigor, comprehensiveness and, most importantly, in-
tegration at the subsystem and system levels. 

Aviation industry standards offer ample measurable criteria 
for gauging specific aging characteristics, such as stress and 
corrosion. The Shuttle Program, by contrast, lacks a closed-
loop feedback system and consequently does not take full 
advantage of all available data to adjust its certification pro-
cess  and  maintenance  practices.  Data  sources  can  include 
experience with material and component failures, non-con-
formances (deviations from original specifications) discov-
ered during Orbiter Maintenance Down Periods, Analytical 
Condition Inspections, and Aging Aircraft studies. Several 
of the recommendations in this report constitute the basis for 
a recertification program (such as the call for nondestructive 
evaluation of RCC components). Chapters 3 and 4 cite in-
stances of waivers and certification of components for flight 
based  on  analysis  rather  than  testing.  The  recertification 
program should correct all those deficiencies. 

Finally, recertification is but one aspect of a Service Life Ex-
tension Program that is essential if the Shuttle is to continue 
operating for another 10 to 20 years. While NASA has such 
a program, it is in its infancy and needs to be pursued with 
vigor. The Service Life Extension Program goes beyond the 
Shuttle itself and addresses critical associated components 

in equipment, infrastructure, and other areas. Aspects of the 
program are addressed in Appendix D.15. 

The Board makes the following recommendation regarding 
recertification:

R9.2-1 

Prior  to  operating  the  Shuttle  beyond  2010, 
develop and conduct a vehicle recertification at 
the material, component, subsystem, and system 
levels.  Recertification  requirements  should  be 
included in the Service Life Extension Program.

9.3  LONG-TERM: FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR THE 

U.S. IN SPACE 

The Board in its investigation has focused on the physical 
and organizational causes of the Columbia accident and the 
recommended actions required for future safe Shuttle opera-
tion. In the course of that investigation, however, two reali-
ties affecting those recommendations have become evident 
to the Board. One is the lack, over the past three decades, 
of  any  national  mandate  providing  NASA  a  compelling 
mission requiring human presence in space. President John 
Kennedyʼs 1961 charge to send Americans to the moon and 
return them safely to Earth “before this decade is out” linked 
NASAʼs efforts to core Cold War national interests. Since 
the 1970s, NASA has not been charged with carrying out a 
similar high priority mission that would justify the expendi-
ture of resources on a scale equivalent to those allocated for 
Project Apollo. The result is the agency has found it neces-
sary to gain the support of diverse constituencies. NASA has 
had to participate in the give and take of the normal political 
process in order to obtain the resources needed to carry out 
its programs. NASA has usually failed to receive budgetary 
support consistent with its ambitions. The result, as noted 
throughout Part Two of the report, is an organization strain-
ing to do too much with too little. 

A second reality, following from the lack of a clearly defined 
long-term space mission, is the lack of sustained government 
commitment over the past decade to improving U.S. access 
to space by developing a second-generation space transpor-
tation system. Without a compelling reason to do so, succes-
sive Administrations and Congresses have not been willing 
to commit the billions of dollars required to develop such a 
vehicle. In addition, the space community has proposed to 
the government the development of vehicles such as the Na-
tional Aerospace Plane and X-33, which required “leapfrog” 
advances in technology; those advances have proven to be 
unachievable. As Apollo 11 Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, one of 
the members of the recent Commission on the Future of the 
United States Aerospace Industry, commented in the Com-
missionʼs November 2002 report, “Attempts at developing 
breakthrough space transportation systems have proved il-
lusory.”1 The Board believes that the country should plan 
for future space transportation capabilities without making 
them dependent on technological breakthroughs.

Lack of a National Vision for Space 

In 1969 President Richard Nixon rejected NASAʼs sweeping 
vision  for  a  post-Apollo  effort  that  involved  full  develop-

R e p o r t   V o l u m e   I       A u g u s t   2 0 0 3

ment of low-Earth orbit, permanent outposts on the moon, 
and initial journeys to Mars. Since that rejection, these objec-
tives have reappeared as central elements in many proposals 
setting forth a long-term vision for the U.S. Space program. 
In  1986  the  National  Commission  on  Space  proposed  “a 
pioneering  mission  for  21st-century America:  To  lead  the 
exploration and development of the space frontier, advanc-
ing science, technology, and enterprise, and building institu-
tions and systems that make accessible vast new resources 
and support human settlements beyond Earth orbit, from the 
highlands of the Moon to the plains of Mars.”2 In 1989, on the 
20th anniversary of the first lunar landing, President George 
H.W. Bush proposed a Space Exploration Initiative, calling 
for “a sustained program of manned exploration of the solar 
system.”3 Space advocates have been consistent in their call 
for sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit as the appropri-
ate objective of U.S. space activities. Review committees as 
diverse as the 1990 Advisory Committee on the Future of 
the U.S. Space Program, chaired by Norman Augustine, and 
the 2001 International Space Station Management and Cost 
Evaluation Task Force have suggested that the primary justi-
fication for a space station is to conduct the research required 
to plan missions to Mars and/or other distant destinations. 
However,  human  travel  to  destinations  beyond  Earth  orbit 
has not been adopted as a national objective.

The  report  of  the  Augustine  Committee  commented,  “It 
seems that most Americans do support a viable space pro-
gram for the nation – but no two individuals seem able to 
agree upon what that space program should be.”4 The Board 
observes that none of the competing long-term visions for 
space have found support from the nationʼs leadership, or 
indeed  among  the  general  public. The  U.S.  civilian space 
effort has moved forward for more than 30 years without a 
guiding vision, and none seems imminent. In the past, this 
absence of a strategic vision in itself has reflected a policy 
decision, since there have been many opportunities for na-
tional  leaders  to  agree  on  ambitious  goals  for  space,  and 
none have done so. 

The Board does observe that there is one area of agreement 
among almost all parties interested in the future of U.S. ac-
tivities in space: The United States needs improved access for 
humans to low-Earth orbit as a foundation for whatever di-
rections the nationʼs space program takes in the future. In the 
Boardʼs view, a full national debate on how best to achieve 
such improved access should take place in parallel with the 
steps the Board has recommended for returning the Space 
Shuttle to flight and for keeping it operating safely in coming 
years. Recommending the content of this debate goes well 
beyond the Boardʼs mandate, but we believe that the White 
House, Congress, and NASA should honor the memory of 
Columbiaʼs crew by reflecting on the nationʼs future in space 
and the role of new space transportation capabilities in en-
abling whatever space goals the nation chooses to pursue.

All members of the Board agree that Americaʼs future space 
efforts  must  include  human  presence  in  Earth  orbit,  and 
eventually beyond, as outlined in the current NASA vision. 
Recognizing  the  absence  of  an  agreed  national  mandate 
cited  above,  the  current  NASA  strategic  plan  stresses  an 
approach  of  investing  in  “transformational  technologies” 

that will enable the development of capabilities to serve as 
“stepping stones” for whatever path the nation may decide it 
wants to pursue in space. While the Board has not reviewed 
this plan in depth, this approach seems prudent. Absent any 
long-term statement of what the country wants to accom-
plish in space, it is difficult to state with any specificity the 
requirements that should guide major public investments in 
new  capabilities. The  Board  does  believe  that  NASA  and 
the nation should give more attention to developing a new 
“concept of operations” for future activities – defining the 
range of activities the country intends to carry out in space 
– that could provide more specificity than currently exists. 
Such a concept does not necessarily require full agreement 
on a future vision, but it should help identify the capabilities 
required and prevent the debate from focusing solely on the 
design of the next vehicle.

Developing a New Space Transportation System 

When  the  Space  Shuttle  development  was  approved  in 
1972, there was a corresponding decision not to fund tech-
nologies  for  space  transportation  other  than  those  related 
to the Shuttle. This decision guided policy for more than 
20 years, until the National Space Transportation Policy of 
1994 assigned NASA the role of developing a next-genera-
tion,  advanced-technology,  single-stage-to-orbit  replace-
ment for the Space Shuttle. That decision was flawed for 
several reasons. Because the United States had not funded 
a broad portfolio of space transportation technologies for 
the preceding three decades, there was a limited technology 
base on which to base the choice of this second-generation 
system. The technologies chosen for development in 1996, 
which  were  embodied  in  the  X-33  demonstrator,  proved 
not yet mature enough for use. Attracted by the notion of 
a  growing  private  sector  market  for  space  transportation, 
the Clinton Administration hoped this new system could be 
developed with minimal public investment – the hope was 
that the private sector would help pay for the development 
of a Shuttle replacement. 

In  recent  years  there  has  been  increasing  investment  in 
space  transportation  technologies,  particularly  through 
NASAʼs Space Launch Initiative effort, begun in 2000. This 
investment has not yet created a technology base for a sec-
ond-generation reusable system for carrying people to orbit. 
Accordingly, in 2002 NASA decided to reorient the Space 
Launch Initiative to longer-term objectives, and to introduce 
the concept of an Orbital Space Plane as an interim comple-
ment to the Space Shuttle for space station crew-carrying re-
sponsibilities. The Integrated Space Transportation Plan also 
called  for  using  the  Space  Shuttle  for  an  extended  period 
into the future. The Board has evaluated neither NASAʼs In-
tegrated Space Transportation Plan nor the detailed require-
ments of an Orbital Space Plane.

Even  so,  based  on  its  in-depth  examination  of  the  Space 
Shuttle  Program,  the  Board  has  reached  an  inescapable 
conclusion:  Because  of  the  risks  inherent  in  the  original 
design of the Space Shuttle, because that design was based 
in many aspects on now-obsolete technologies, and because 
the Shuttle is now an aging system but still developmental in 
character, it is in the nationʼs interest to replace the Shuttle

Final Conclusions 

The Boardʼs perspective assumes, of course, that the United 
States wants to retain a continuing capability to send people 
into space, whether to Earth orbit or beyond. The Boardʼs 
work  over  the  past  seven  months  has  been  motivated  by 
the  desire  to  honor  the  STS-107  crew  by  understanding 
the cause of the accident in which they died, and to help 
the  United  States  and  indeed  all  spacefaring  countries  to 
minimize the risks of future loss of lives in the exploration 
of space. The United States should continue with a Human 
Space Flight Program consistent with the resolve voiced by 
President George W. Bush on February 1, 2003: “Mankind 
is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration 
of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey into 
space will go on.”

as soon as possible as the primary means for transporting 
humans to and from Earth orbit. At least in the mid-term, 
that  replacement  will  be  some  form  of  what  NASA  now 
characterizes as an Orbital Space Plane. The design of the 
system should give overriding priority to crew safety, rather 
than trade safety against other performance criteria, such as 
low cost and reusability, or against advanced space opera-
tion capabilities other than crew transfer.

This conclusion implies that whatever design NASA chooses 
should become the primary means for taking people to and 
from the International Space Station, not just a complement 
to the Space Shuttle. And it follows from the same conclusion 
that there is urgency in choosing that design, after serious 
review of a “concept of operations” for human space flight, 
and  bringing  it  into  operation  as  soon  as  possible. This  is 
likely to require a significant commitment of resources over 
the next several years. The nation must not shy from making 
that commitment. The International Space Station is likely 
to be the major destination for human space travel for the 
next decade or longer. The Space Shuttle would continue to 
be used when its unique capabilities are required, both with 
respect to space station missions such as experiment delivery 
and retrieval or other logistical missions, and with respect to 
the few planned missions not traveling to the space station. 
When cargo can be carried to the space station or other desti-
nations by an expendable launch vehicle, it should be.

However, the Orbital Space Plane is seen by NASA as an 
interim system for transporting humans to orbit. NASA plans 
to make continuing investments in “next generation launch 
technology,” with the hope that those investments will en-
able a decision by the end of this decade on what that next 
generation launch vehicle should be. This is a worthy goal, 
and should be pursued. The Board notes that this approach 
can only be successful: if it is sustained over the decade; if by 
the time a decision to develop a new vehicle is made there is 
a clearer idea of how the new space transportation system fits 
into the nationʼs overall plans for space; and if the U.S. gov-
ernment is willing at the time a development decision is made 
to commit the substantial resources required to implement it. 
One of the major problems with the way the Space Shuttle 
Program was carried out was an a priori fixed ceiling on de-
velopment costs. That approach should not be repeated. 

It is the view of the Board that the previous attempts to de-
velop a replacement vehicle for the aging Shuttle represent 
a  failure  of  national  leadership.  The  cause  of  the  failure 
was continuing to expect major technological advances in 
that vehicle. With the amount of risk inherent in the Space 
Shuttle, the first step should be to reach an agreement that 
the overriding mission of the replacement system is to move 
humans safely and reliably into and out of Earth orbit. To 
demand more would be to fall into the same trap as all previ-
ous, unsuccessful, efforts. That being said, it seems to the 
Board that past and future investments in space launch tech-
nologies should certainly provide by 2010 or thereabouts the 
basis for developing a system, significantly improved over 
one designed 40 years earlier, for carrying humans to orbit 
and enabling their work in space. Continued U.S. leadership 
in space is an important national objective. That leadership 
depends on a willingness to pay the costs of achieving it.

CHAPTER 10

Other
Significant Observations

Although  the  Board  now  understands  the  combination  of 
technical and organizational factors that contributed to the 
Columbia  accident,  the  investigation  did  not  immediately 
zero in on the causes identified in previous chapters. Instead, 
the Board explored a number of avenues and topics that, in 
the  end,  were  not  directly  related  to  the  cause  of  this  ac-
cident. Nonetheless, these forays revealed technical, safety, 
and cultural issues that could impact the Space Shuttle Pro-
gram, and, more broadly, the future of human space flight. 
The significant issues listed in this chapter are potentially 
serious matters that should be addresed by NASA because 
they fall into the category of “weak signals” that could be 
indications of future problems.
10.1 PUBLIC SAFETY
 
Shortly after the breakup of Columbia over Texas, dramatic 
images of the Orbiterʼs debris surfaced: an intact spherical 
tank in an empty parking lot, an obliterated office rooftop, 
mangled metal along roadsides, charred chunks of material 
in fields. These images, combined with the large number of 
debris fragments that were recovered, compelled many to 
proclaim it was a “miracle” that no one on the ground had 
been hurt.1

The  Columbia  accident  raises  some  important  questions 
about public safety. What were the chances that the general 
public  could  have  been  hurt  by  a  breakup  of  an  Orbiter? 
How safe are Shuttle flights compared with those of con-
ventional aircraft? How much public risk from space flight 
is acceptable? Who is responsible for public safety during 
space flight operations? 

Public Risk from Columbiaʼs Breakup

The Board commissioned a study to determine if the lack of 
reported injuries on the ground was a predictable outcome or 
simply exceptionally good fortune (see Appendix D.16). The 
study extrapolated from an array of data, including census 
figures for the debris impact area, the Orbiterʼs last reported 

position and velocity, the impact locations (latitude and lon-
gitude), and the total weight of all recovered debris, as well 
as the composition and dimensions of many debris pieces.2

Based on the best available evidence on Columbiaʼs disinte-
gration and ground impact, the lack of serious injuries on the 
ground was the expected outcome for the location and time 
at which the breakup occurred.3 

NASA  and  others  have  developed  sophisticated  computer 
tools to predict the trajectory and survivability of spacecraft 
debris during re-entry.4 Such tools have been used to assess 
the risk of serious injuries to the public due to spacecraft 
re-entry,  including  debris  impacts  from  launch  vehicle 
malfunctions.5 However, it is impossible to be certain about 
what fraction of Columbia survived to impact the ground. 
Some  38  percent  of  Columbiaʼs  dry  (empty)  weight  was 
recovered, but there is no way to determine how much still 
lies on the ground. Accounting for the inherent uncertainties 
associated with the amount of ground debris and the num-
ber of people outdoors,6 there was about a 9- to 24-percent 
chance of at least one person being seriously injured by the 
disintegration of the Orbiter.7 

Debris  fell  on  a  relatively  sparsely  populated  area  of  the 
United States, with an average of about 85 inhabitants per 
square  mile.  Orbiter  re-entry  flight  paths  often  pass  over 
much  more  populated  areas,  including  major  cities  that 
average  more  than  1,000  inhabitants  per  square  mile.  For 
example,  the  STS-107  re-entry  profile  passed  over  Sac-
ramento,  California,  and Albuquerque,  New  Mexico.  The 
Board-sponsored  study  concluded  that,  given  the  unlikely 
event of a similar Orbiter breakup over a densely populated 
area such as Houston, the most likely outcome would be one 
or two ground casualties.

Space Flight Risk Compared to Aircraft Operations

A  recent  study  of  U.S.  civil  aviation  accidents  found  that 
between 1964 and 1999, falling aircraft debris killed an av-

R e p o r t   V o l u m e   I       A u g u s t   2 0 0 3

erage of eight people per year.8 In comparison, the National 
Center for Health Statistics reports that between 1992 and 
1994,  an  average  of  65  people  in  the  United  States  were 
killed each year by lightning strikes. The aviation accident 
study revealed a decreasing trend in the annual number of 
“groundling”  fatalities,  so  that  an  average  of  about  four 
fatalities per year are predicted in the near future.9 The prob-
ability of a U.S. resident being killed by aircraft debris is 
now less than one in a million over a 70-year lifetime.10 

The history of U.S. space flight has a flawless public safety 
record. Since the 1950s, there have been hundreds of U.S. 
space launches without a single member of the public being 
injured. Comparisons between the risk to the public from 
space flight and aviation operations are limited by two fac-
tors: the absence of public injuries resulting from U.S. space 
flight operations, and the relatively small number of space 
flights  (hundreds)  compared  to  aircraft  flights  (billions).11 
Nonetheless, it is unlikely that U.S. space flights will pro-
duce many, if any, public injuries in the coming years based 
on (1) the low number of space flight operations per year, (2) 
the flawless public safety record of past U.S. space launches, 
(3) government-adopted space flight safety standards,12 and 
(4) the risk assessment result that, even in the unlikely event 
of a similar Orbiter breakup over a major city, less than two 
ground casualties would be expected. In short, the risk posed 
to people on the ground by U.S. space flight operations is 
small compared to the risk from civil aircraft operations.

The government has sought to limit public risk from space 
flight to levels comparable to the risk produced by aircraft. 
U.S. space launch range commanders have agreed that the 
public should face no more than a one-in-a-million chance 
of fatality from launch vehicle and unmanned aircraft op-
erations.13 This aligns with Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) regulations that individuals be exposed to no more 
than a one-in-a-million chance of serious injury due to com-
mercial space launch and re-entry operations.14 

NASA  has  not  actively  followed  public  risk  acceptability 
standards  used  by  other  government  agencies  during  past 
Orbiter re-entry operations. However, in the aftermath of the 
Columbia accident, the agency has attempted to adopt similar 
rules to protect the public. It has also developed computer 
tools to predict the survivability of spacecraft debris during 
re-entry. Such tools have been used to assess the risk of public 
casualties attributable to spacecraft re-entry, including debris 
impacts from commercial launch vehicle malfunctions.15

Responsibility for Public Safety

The  Director  of  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  is  responsible 
for the ground and flight safety of Kennedy Space Center 
people and property for all launches.16 The Air Force pro-
vides the Director with written notification of launch area 
risk estimates for Shuttle ascents. The Air Force routinely 
computes the risk that Shuttle ascents17 pose to people on 
and  off  Kennedy  grounds  from  potential  debris  impacts, 
toxic exposures, and explosions.18 

However, no equivalent collaboration exists between NASA 
and the Air Force for re-entry risk. FAA rules on commercial 

space launch activities do not apply “where the Government 
is so substantially involved that it is effectively directing or 
controlling the launch.” Based on the lack of a response, in 
tandem with NASAʼs public statements and informal replies 
to Board questions, the Board determined that NASA made 
no documented effort to assess public risk from Orbiter re-
entry operations prior to the Columbia accident. The Board 
believes that NASA should be legally responsible for public 
safety during all phases of Shuttle operations, including re-
entry.

Findings:

F10.1-1  The Columbia accident demonstrated that Orbiter 
breakup during re-entry has the potential to cause 
casualties among the general public.

F10.1-2  Given  the  best  information  available  to  date, 
a  formal  risk  analysis  sponsored  by  the  Board 
found  that  the  lack  of  general-public  casualties 
from Columbiaʼs break-up was the expected out-
come.

F10.1-3  The  history  of  U.S.  space  flight  has  a  flawless 
public safety record. Since the 1950s, hundreds 
of  space  flights  have  occurred  without  a  single 
public injury. 

F10.1-4  The FAA and U.S. space launch ranges have safe-
ty standards designed to ensure that the general 
public is exposed to less than a one-in-a-million 
chance  of  serious  injury  from  the  operation  of 
space launch vehicles and unmanned aircraft.

F10.1-5  NASA  did  not  demonstrably  follow  public  risk 
acceptability  standards  during  past  Orbiter  re-
entries. NASA efforts are underway to define a 
national policy for the protection of public safety 
during all operations involving space launch ve-
hicles.

Observations:

O10.1-1  NASA  should  develop  and  implement  a  public 
risk acceptability policy for launch and re-entry 
of space vehicles and unmanned aircraft.

O10.1-2  NASA should develop and implement a plan to 
mitigate the risk that Shuttle flights pose to the 
general public.

O10.1-3  NASA  should  study  the  debris  recovered  from 
Columbia  to  facilitate  realistic  estimates  of  the 
risk to the public during Orbiter re-entry.

10.2 CREW ESCAPE AND SURVIVAL

The Board has examined crew escape systems in historical 
context with a view to future improvements. It is important 
to note at the outset that Columbia broke up during a phase 
of flight that, given the current design of the Orbiter, offered 
no possibility of crew survival. 

The goal of every Shuttle mission is the safe return of the 
crew. An escape system—a means for the crew to leave a 
vehicle  in  distress  during  some  or  all  of  its  flight  phases 
and  return  safely  to  Earth  –  has  historically  been  viewed 

2 1 4

R e p o r t   V o l u m e   I       A u g u s t   2 0 0 3

COLUMBIA

A C C I D E N T   I N V E S T I G A T I O N   B O A R D

as one “technique” to accomplish that end. Other methods 
include various abort modes, rescue, and the creation of a 
safe haven (a location where crew members could remain 
unharmed if they are unable to return to Earth aboard a dam-
aged Shuttle).

While crew escape systems have been discussed and stud-
ied  continuously  since  the  Shuttleʼs  early  design  phases, 
only two systems have been incorporated: one for the de-
velopmental  test  flights,  and  the  current  system  installed 
after the Challenger accident. Both designs have extremely 
limited capabilities, and neither has ever been used during 
a mission. 

Developmental Test Flights

Early studies assumed that the Space Shuttle would be op-
erational in every sense of the word. As a result, much like 
commercial airliners, a Shuttle crew escape system was con-
sidered unnecessary. NASA adopted requirements for rapid 
emergency egress of the crew in early Shuttle test flights. 
Modified  SR-71  ejection  seats  for  the  two  pilot  positions 
were installed on the Orbiter test vehicle Enterprise, which 
was carried to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a Boeing 747 
Shuttle Carrier Aircraft during the Approach and Landing 
Tests in 1977.19

Essentially the same system was installed on Columbia and 
used for the four Orbital Test Flights during 1981-82. While 
this system was designed for use during first-stage ascent 
and in gliding flight below 100,000 feet, considerable doubt 
emerged about the survivability of an ejection that would 
expose crew members to the Solid Rocket Booster exhaust 
plume. Regardless, NASA declared the developmental test 
flight phase complete after STS-4, Columbiaʼs fourth flight, 
and the ejection seat system was deactivated. Its associated 
hardware was removed during modification after STS-9. All 
Space  Shuttle  missions  after  STS-4  were  conducted  with 
crews of four or more, and no escape system was installed 
until after the loss of Challenger in 1986.

Before the Challenger accident, the question of crew sur-
vival was not considered independently from the possibility 
of catastrophic Shuttle damage. In short, NASA believed if 
the Orbiter could be saved, then the crew would be safe. Per-
ceived limits of the use of escape systems, along with their 
cost,  engineering  complexity,  and  weight/payload  trade-
offs,  dissuaded  NASA  from  implementing  a  crew  escape 
plan. Instead, the agency focused on preventing the loss of a 
Shuttle as the sole means for assuring crew survival.

Post-Challenger: the Current System

NASAʼs  rejection  of  a  crew  escape  system  was  severely 
criticized after the loss of Challenger. The Rogers Commis-
sion addressed the topic in a recommendation that combined 
the issues of launch abort and crew escape:20

Launch Abort and Crew Escape. The Shuttle Program 
management  considered  first-stage  abort  options  and 
crew  escape  options  several  times  during  the  history 
of the program, but because of limited utility, technical 

infeasibility, or program cost and schedule, no systems 
were implemented. The Commission recommends that 
NASA: 

•  Make all efforts to provide a crew escape system for 

use during controlled gliding flight.

•  Make  every  effort  to  increase  the  range  of  flight 
conditions under which an emergency runway land-
ing can be successfully conducted in the event that 
two or three main engines fail early in ascent. 

In response to this recommendation, NASA developed the 
current “pole bailout” system for use during controlled, sub-
sonic gliding flight (see Figure 10.2-1). The system requires 
crew members to “vent” the cabin at 40,000 feet (to equalize 
the cabin pressure with the pressure at that altitude), jettison 
the hatch at approximately 32,000 feet, and then jump out of 
the vehicle (the pole allows crew members to avoid striking 
the Orbiterʼs wings).

Figure  10.2-1.  A  demonstration  of  the  pole  bailout  system.  The 
pole is extending from the side of a C-141 simulating the Orbiter, 
with a crew member sliding  down the pole so that he would fall 
clear of the Orbiterʼs wing during an actual bailout.

Current Human-Rating Requirements 

In  June  1998,  Johnson  Space  Center  issued  new  Human-
Rating Requirements applicable to “all future human-rated 
spacecraft operated by NASA.” In July 2003, shortly before 
this report was published, NASA issued further Human-Rat-
ing Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems, 
over the signature of the Associate Administrator for Safety 
and Mission Assurance. While these new requirements “… 
shall not supersede more stringent requirements imposed by 
individual NASA organizations …” NASA has informed the 
Board that the earlier – and in some cases more prescriptive 
– Johnson Space Center requirements have been cancelled.

NASAʼs 2003 Human-Rating Requirements and Guidelines 
for Space Flight Systems laid out the following principles 
regarding crew escape and survival:

2.5.4 

Crew survival

2.5.4.1 

2.5.4.2 

As  part  of  the  design  process,  program 
management  (with  approval  from  the 
CHMO  [Chief  Health  and  Medical  Offi-
cer], AA for OSF [Associate Administrator 
for the Office of Spaceflight ], and AA for 
SMA [Associate Administrator for Safety 
and  Mission  Assurance]  shall  establish, 
assess,  and  document  the  program  re-
quirements  for  an  acceptable  life  cycle 
cumulative  probability  of  safe  crew  and 
passenger return. This probability require-
ment can be satisfied through the use of all 
available  mechanisms  including  nominal 
mission completion, abort, safe haven, or 
crew escape. 

The  cumulative  probability  of  safe  crew 
and  passenger  return  shall  address  all 
missions  planned  for  the  life  of  the  pro-
gram, not just a single space flight system 
for a single mission. 

The overall probability of crew and passenger survival must 
meet  the  minimum  program  requirements  (as  defined  in 
section 2.5.4.1) for the stated life of a space flight systems 
program.21 This approach is required to reflect the different 
technical challenges and levels of operational risk exposure 
on various types of missions. For example, low-Earth-orbit 
missions represent fundamentally different risks than does 
the first mission to Mars. Single-mission risk on the order 
of 0.99 for a beyond-Earth-orbit mission may be acceptable, 
but considerably better performance, on the order of 0.9999, 
is expected for a reusable low-Earth-orbit design that will 
make 100 or more flights.

2.6   

2.6.1 

2.6.2 

2.6.3 

Abort and Crew Escape

The  capability  for  rapid  crew  and  occu-
pant  egress  shall  be  provided  during  all 
pre-launch activities.

The  capability  for  crew  and  occupant 
survival and recovery shall be provided on 
ascent using a combination of abort and 
escape.

The  capability  for  crew  and  occupant 
survival  and  recovery  shall  be  provided 
during  all  other  phases  of  flight  (includ-
ing  on-orbit,  reentry,  and  landing)  using 
a  combination  of  abort  and  escape,  un-
less  comprehensive  safety  and  reliability 
analyses  indicate  that  abort  and  escape 
capability  is  not  required  to  meet  crew 
survival requirements.

2.6.4 

Determinations  regarding  escape  and 
abort shall be made based upon compre-
hensive  safety  and  reliability  analyses 
across all mission profiles.

These  new  requirements  focus  on  general  crew  survival 
rather than on particular crew escape systems. This provides 
a logical context for discussions of tradeoffs that will yield 
the  best  crew-survival  outcome.  Such  tradeoffs  include 
“mass-trades”  –  for  example,  an  escape  system  could 
add weight to a vehicle, but in the process cause payload 
changes that require additional missions, thereby inherently 
increasing the overall exposure to risk.

Note that the new requirements for crew escape appear less 
prescriptive  than  Johnson  Space  Center  Requirement  7, 
which deals with “safe crew extraction” from pre-launch to 
landing.22

In addition, the extent to which NASAʼs 2003 requirements 
will retroactively apply to the Space Shuttle is an open ques-
tion:

The Governing Program Management Council (GPMC) 
will determine the applicability of this document to pro-
grams and projects in existence (e.g., heritage expend-
able and reusable launch vehicles and evolved expend-
able launch vehicles), at or beyond implementation, at 
the time of the issuance of this document. 

Recommendations of the NASA Aerospace Safety 
Advisory Panel

The  issue  of  crew  escape  has  long  been  a  matter  of  con-
cern  to  NASAʼs Aerospace  Safety Advisory  Panel.  In  its 
2002 Annual Report, the panel noted that NASA Program 
Guidelines on Human Rating require escape systems for all 
flight vehicles, but the guidelines do not apply to the Space 
Shuttle. The Panel considered it appropriate, in view of the 
Shuttleʼs proposed life extension, to consider upgrading the 
vehicle to comply with the guidelines.23

Recommendation 02-9: Complete the ongoing studies 
of crew escape design options. Either document the rea-
sons for not implementing the NASA Program Guide-
lines on Human Rating or expedite the deployment of 
such capabilities.

The  Board  shares  the  concern  of  the  NASA  Aerospace 
Safety Advisory Panel and others over the lack of a crew es-
cape system for the Space Shuttle that could cover the wid-
est possible range of flight regimes and emergencies. At the 
same time, a crew escape system is just one element to be 
optimized for crew survival. Crucial tradeoffs in risk, com-
plexity, weight, and operational utility must be made when 
considering a Shuttle escape system. Designs for future ve-
hicles and possible retrofits should be evaluated in this con-
text. The sole objective must be the highest probability of a 
crewʼs safe return regardless if that is due to successful mis-
sion completions, vehicle-intact aborts, safe haven/rescues, 
escape systems, or some combination of these scenarios.

Finally, a crew escape system cannot be considered sepa-
rately  from  the  issues  of  Shuttle  retirement/replacement, 
separation of cargo from crew in future vehicles, and other 
considerations in the development – and the inherent risks 
of space flight.

Space flight is an inherently dangerous undertaking, and will 
remain so for the foreseeable future. While all efforts must 
be taken to minimize its risks, the White House, Congress, 
and the American public must acknowledge these dangers 
and be prepared to accept their consequences.

Observations:

O10.2-1  Future  crewed-vehicle  requirements  should  in-
corporate the knowledge gained from the Chal-
lenger and Columbia accidents in assessing the 
feasibility  of  vehicles  that  could  ensure  crew 
survival even if the vehicle is destroyed. 
10.3 SHUTTLE ENGINEERING DRAWINGS AND 

CLOSEOUT PHOTOGRAPHS

In the years since the Shuttle was designed, NASA has not 
updated its engineering drawings or converted to computer-
aided drafting systems. The Boardʼs review of these engi-
neering  drawings  revealed  numerous  inaccuracies.  In  par-
ticular, the drawings do not incorporate many engineering 
changes made in the last two decades. Equally troubling was 
the difficulty in obtaining these drawings: it took up to four 
weeks to receive them, and, though some photographs were 
available as a short-term substitute, closeout photos took up 
to six weeks to obtain. (Closeout photos are pictures taken 
of Shuttle areas before they are sealed off for flight.) The 
Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel noted similar difficulties 
in its 2001 and 2002 reports. 

The  Board  believes  that  the  Shuttleʼs  current  engineer-
ing  drawing  system  is  inadequate  for  another  20  yearsʼ 
use.  Widespread  inaccuracies,  unincorporated  engineering 
updates,  and  significant  delays  in  this  system  represent  a 
significant dilemma for NASA in the event of an on-orbit 
crisis that requires timely and accurate engineering informa-
tion. The dangers of an inaccurate and inaccessible draw-
ing system are exacerbated by the apparent lack of readily 
available closeout photographs as interim replacements (see 
Appendix D.15).

Findings:

F10.3-1  The  engineering  drawing  system  contains  out-
dated information and is paper-based rather than 
computer-aided. 

F10.3-2  The  current  drawing  system  cannot  quickly 
portray Shuttle sub-systems for on-orbit trouble-
shooting.

F10.3-3  NASA  normally  uses  closeout  photographs  but 
lacks  a  clear  system  to  define  which  critical 
sub-systems should have such photographs. The 
current system does not allow the immediate re-
trieval of closeout photos.

Recommendations:

R10.3-1  Develop  an  interim  program  of  closeout  pho-
tographs for all critical sub-systems that differ 
from engineering drawings. Digitize the close-
out photograph system so that images are imme-
diately available for on-orbit troubleshooting. 

R10.3-2  Provide adequate resources for a long-term pro-
gram to upgrade the Shuttle engineering drawing 
system including:

•  Reviewing drawings for accuracy
•  Converting  all  drawings  to  a  computer-

aided drafting system

•  Incorporating engineering changes

10.4 INDUSTRIAL SAFETY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

The  industrial  safety  programs  in  place  at  NASA  and  its 
contractors  are  robust  and  in  good  health.  However,  the 
scope  and  depth  of  NASAʼs  maintenance  and  quality  as-
surance programs are troublesome. Though unrelated to the 
Columbia accident, the major deficiencies in these programs 
uncovered  by  the  Board  could  potentially  contribute  to  a 
future accident.

Industrial Safety

Industrial  safety  programs  at  NASA  and  its  contractors—
covering  safety  measures  “on  the  shop  floor”  and  in  the 
workplace – were examined by interviews, observations, and 
reviews. Vibrant industrial safety programs were found in ev-
ery area examined, reflecting a common interview comment: 
“If anything, we go overboard on safety.” Industrial safety 
programs are highly visible: they are nearly always a topic 
of work center meetings and are represented by numerous 
safety campaigns and posters (see Figure 10.4-1). 

Figure 10.4-1. Safety posters at NASA and contractor facilities.

Initiatives  like  Michoudʼs  “This  is  Stupid”  program  and 
the  United  Space  Allianceʼs  “Time  Out”  cards  empower 
employees to halt any operation under way if they believe 
industrial safety is being compromised (see Figure 10.4-2). 
For example, the Time Out program encourages and even 
rewards workers who report suspected safety problems to 
management.

NASA  similarly  maintains  the  Safety  Reporting  System, 
which creates lines of communication through which anon-
ymous  inputs  are  forwarded  directly  to  headquarters  (see 
Figure 10.4-3). The NASA Shuttle Logistics Depot focus on 
safety has been recognized as an Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration Star Site for its participation in the 
Voluntary  Protection  Program. After  the  Shuttle  Logistics 
Depot was recertified in 2002, employees worked more than 
750 days without a lost-time mishap. 

Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance  programs  –  encompassing  steps  to  en-
courage error-free work, as well as inspections and assess-
ments of that work – have evolved considerably in scope 
over the past five years, transitioning from intensive, com-
prehensive inspection regimens to much smaller programs 
based on past risk analysis. 

As described in Part Two, after the Space Flight Operations 
Contract  was  established,  NASAʼs  quality  assurance  role 
at Kennedy Space Center was significantly reduced. In the 
course  of  this  transition,  Kennedy  reduced  its  inspections 
–  called  Government  Mandatory  Inspection  Points  –  by 
more than 80 percent. Marshall Space Flight Center cut its 
inspection  workload  from  49,000  government  inspection 
points and 821,000 contractor inspections in 1990 to 13,700 
and 461,000, respectively, in 2002. Similar cutbacks were 
made at most NASA centers. 

Inspection requirements are specified in the Quality Planning 
Requirements Document (also called the Mandatory Inspec-

tions  Document).  United  Space Alliance  technicians  must 
document an estimated 730,000 tasks to complete a single 
Shuttle maintenance flow at Kennedy Space Center. Nearly 
every task assessed as Criticality Code 1, 1R (redundant), or 
2 is always inspected, as are any systems not verifiable by op-
erational checks or tests prior to final preparations for flight.

Nearly everyone interviewed at Kennedy indicated that the 
current inspection process is both inadequate and difficult 
to  expand,  even  incrementally.  One  example  was  a  long-
standing request to add a main engine final review before 
transporting the engine to the Orbiter Processing Facility for 
installation. This request was first voiced two years before 
the launch of STS-107, and has been repeatedly denied due 
to inadequate staffing. In its place, NASA Mission Assur-
ance conducts a final “informal” review. Adjusting govern-
ment inspection tasks is constrained by institutional dogma 
that the status quo is based on strong engineering logic, and 
should need no adjustment. This mindset inhibits the ability 
of Quality Assurance to respond to an aging system, chang-
ing workforce dynamics, and improvement initiatives.

The  Quality  Planning  Requirements  Document,  which  de-
fines inspection requirements, was well formulated but is not 
routinely reviewed. Indeed, NASA seems reluctant to add or 
subtract  government  inspections,  particularly  at  Kennedy. 
Additions  and  subtractions  are  rare,  and  generally  occur 
only as a response to obvious problems. For instance, NASA 
augmented wiring inspections after STS-93 in 1999, when a 
short circuit shut down two of Columbiaʼs Main Engine Con-
trollers. Interviews confirmed that the current Requirements 
Document lacks numerous critical items, but conversely de-
mands redundant and unnecessary inspections.

The NASA/United Space Alliance Quality Assurance pro-
cesses at Kennedy are not fully integrated with each other, 
with Safety, Health, and Independent Assessment, or with 
Engineering  Surveillance  Programs.  Individually,  each 
plays a vital role in the control and assessment of the Shuttle 
as it comes together in the Orbiter Processing Facility and 
Vehicle Assembly Building. Were they to be carefully inte-
grated, these programs could attain a nearly comprehensive 
quality control process. Marshall has a similar challenge. It

is  responsible  for  managing  several  different  Shuttle  sys-
tems through contractors who maintain mostly proprietary 
databases,  and  therefore,  integration  is  limited.  The  main 
engine program overcomes this challenge by being centrally 
organized under a single Mission Assurance Division Chief 
who  reports  to  the  Marshall  Center  Director.  In  contrast, 
Kennedy has a separate Mission Assurance office working 
directly for each program, a separate Safety, Health, and In-
dependent Assessment office under the Center Director, and 
separate quality engineers under each program. Observing 
the effectiveness of Marshall, and other successful Mission 
Assurance programs (such as at Johnson Space Center), a 
solution  may  be  the  consolidation  of  the  Kennedy  Space 
Center Quality Assurance program under one Mission As-
surance office, which would report to the Center Director. 

While reports by the 1986 Rogers Commission, 2000 Shuttle 
Independent Assessment Team, and 2003 internal Kennedy 
Tiger Team all affirmed the need for a strong and independent 
Quality Assurance Program, Kennedyʼs Program has taken 
the  opposite  tack.  Kennedyʼs  Quality  Assurance  program 
discrepancy-tracking system is inadequate to nonexistent.

Robust as recently as three years ago, Kennedy no longer 
has  a  “closed  loop”  system  in  which  discrepancies  and 
their remedies circle back to the person who first noted the 
problem. Previous methods included the NASA Corrective 
Action Report, two-way memos, and other tools that helped 
ensure that a discrepancy would be addressed and corrected. 
The  Kennedy  Quality  Program  Manager  cancelled  these 
programs  in  favor  of  a  contractor-run  database  called  the 
Quality  Control  Assessment  Tool.  However,  it  does  not 
demand a closed-loop or reply deadline, and suffers from 
limitations on effective data entry and retrieval. 
 
Kennedy  Quality Assurance  management  has  recently  fo-
cused its efforts on implementing the International Organiza-
tion for Standardization (ISO) 9000/9001, a process-driven 
program originally intended for manufacturing plants. Board 
observations and interviews underscore areas where Kenne-
dy has diverged from its Apollo-era reputation of setting the 
standard for quality. With the implementation of Internation-
al Standardization, it could devolve further. While ISO 9000/
9001 expresses strong principles, they are more applicable 
to manufacturing and repetitive-procedure industries, such as

running a major airline, than to a research-and-development, 
non-operational flight test environment like that of the Space 
Shuttle. NASA technicians may perform a specific procedure 
only three or four times a year, in contrast with their airline 
counterparts, who perform procedures dozens of times each 
week.  In  NASAʼs  own  words  regarding  standardization, 
“ISO  9001  is  not  a  management  panacea,  and  is  never  a 
replacement for management taking responsibility for sound 
decision making.” Indeed, many perceive International Stan-
dardization as emphasizing process over product.

Efforts by Kennedy Quality Assurance management to move 
its workforce towards a “hands-off, eyes-off” approach are 
unsettling.  To  use  a  term  coined  by  the  2000  Shuttle  In-
dependent Assessment  Team  Report,  “diving  catches,”  or 
last-minute  saves,  continue  to  occur  in  maintenance  and 
processing and pose serious hazards to Shuttle safety. More 
disturbingly, some proverbial balls are not caught until af-
ter  flight.  For  example,  documentation  revealed  instances 
where Shuttle components stamped “ground test only” were 
detected  both  before  and  after  they  had  flown. Addition-
ally, testimony and documentation submitted by witnesses 
revealed components that had flown “as is” without proper 
disposition  by  the  Material  Review  Board  prior  to  flight, 
which implies a growing acceptance of risk. Such incidents 
underscore the need to expand government inspections and 
surveillance,  and  highlight  a  lack  of  communication  be-
tween NASA employees and contractors. 

Another indication of continuing problems lies in an opinion 
voiced by many witnesses that is confirmed by Board track-
ing: Kennedy Quality Assurance management discourages 
inspectors  from  rejecting  contractor  work.  Inspectors  are 
told  to  cooperate  with  contractors  to  fix  problems  rather 
than  rejecting  the  work  and  forcing  contractors  to  resub-
mit it. With a rejection, discrepancies become a matter of 
record; in this new process, discrepancies are not recorded 
or tracked. As a result, discrepancies are currently not being 
tracked in any easily accessible database. 

Of  the  141,127  inspections  subject  to  rejection  from  Oc-
tober  2000  through  March  2003,  only  20  rejections,  or 
“hexes,” were recorded, resulting in a statistically improb-
able discrepancy rate of .014 percent (see Figure 10.4-4). In 
interviews, technicians and inspectors alike confirmed the 
dubiousness  of  this  rate.  NASAʼs  published  rejection  rate 
therefore  indicates  either  inadequate  documentation  or  an 
underused system. Testimony further revealed incidents of 
quality assurance inspectors being played against each other 
to accept work that had originally been refused.

Findings:

Shuttle System industrial safety programs are in 
good health.

F10.4-2  The  Quality  Planning  Requirements  Document, 
which  defines  inspection  conditions,  was  well 
formulated.  However,  there  is  no  requirement 
that it be routinely reviewed.

mandatory inspection process is both inadequate 
and difficult to expand, which inhibits the ability

of  Quality Assurance  to  process  improvement 
initiatives. 

F10.4-4  Kennedyʼs quality assurance system encourages 
inspectors to allow incorrect work to be corrected 
without being labeled “rejected.” These opportu-
nities hide “rejections,” making it impossible to 
determine how often and on what items frequent 
rejections and errors occur.

Observations:

O10.4-1  Perform an independently led, bottom-up review 
of the Kennedy Space Center Quality Planning 
Requirements  Document  to  address  the  entire 
quality  assurance  program  and  its  administra-
tion. This review should include development of 
a responsive system to add or delete government 
mandatory inspections.

O10.4-2  Kennedy  Space  Centerʼs  Quality  Assurance 
programs  should  be  consolidated  under  one 
Mission Assurance office, which reports to the 
Center Director.

O10.4-3  Kennedy Space Center quality assurance man-
agement  must  work  with  NASA  and  perhaps 
the Department of Defense to develop training 
programs for its personnel.

O10.4-4  Kennedy  Space  Center  should  examine  which 
areas  of  International  Organization  for  Stan-
dardization 9000/9001 truly apply to a 20-year-
old  research  and  development  system  like  the 
Space Shuttle.

10.5 MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTATION

The  Board  reviewed  Columbiaʼs  maintenance  records  for 
any  documentation  problems,  evidence  of  maintenance 
flaws,  or  significant  omissions,  and  simultaneously  inves-
tigated  the  organizations  and  management  responsible  for 
this  documentation.  The  review  revealed  both  inaccurate 
data entries and a widespread inability to find and correct 
these inaccuracies.

The Board asked Kennedy Space Center and United Space 
Alliance  to  review  documentation  for  STS-107,  STS-109, 
and Columbiaʼs most recent Orbiter Major Modification. A 
NASA Process Review Team, consisting of 445 NASA engi-
neers, contractor engineers, and Quality Assurance person-
nel, reviewed some 16,500 Work Authorization Documents, 
and  provided  a  list  of  Findings  (potential  relationships  to 
the  accident),  Technical  Observations  (technical  concerns 
or process issues), and Documentation Observations (minor 
errors). The list contained one Finding related to the Exter-
nal Tank bipod ramp. None of the Observations contributed 
to the accident.

The Process Review Teamʼs sampling plan resulted in excel-
lent observations.24 The number of observations is relatively 
low  compared  to  the  total  amount  of Work Authorization 
Documents  reviewed,  ostensibly  yielding  a  99.75  percent 
accuracy rate. While this number is high, a closer review of 
the data reveals some of the systemʼs weaknesses. Techni-
cal Observations are delineated into 17 categories. Five of 

these  categories  are  of  particular  concern  for  mishap  pre-
vention and reinforce the need for process improvements. 
The category entitled “System configuration could damage 
hardware” is listed 112 times. Categories that deal with poor 
incorporation of technical guidance are of particular interest 
due to the Boardʼs concern over the backlog of unincorpo-
rated engineering orders. Finally, a category entitled “paper 
has open work steps,” indicates that the review system failed 
to catch a potentially significant oversight 310 times in this 
sample. (The complete results of this review may be found 
in Appendix D.14.)

The  current  process  includes  three  or  more  layers  of 
oversight  before  paperwork  is  scanned  into  the  database. 
However,  if  review  authorities  are  not  aware  of  the  most 
common problems to look for, corrections cannot be made. 
Routine sampling will help refine this process and cut errors 
significantly. 

Observations:

O10.5-1  Quality  and  Engineering  review  of  work  docu-
ments for STS-114 should be accomplished using 
statistical sampling to ensure that a representative 
sample  is  evaluated  and  adequate  feedback  is 
communicated  to  resolve  documentation  prob-
lems. 

O10.5-2  NASA should implement United Space Allianceʼs 
suggestions for process improvement, which rec-
ommend  including  a  statistical  sampling  of  all 
future paperwork to identify recurring problems 
and implement corrective actions. 

O10.5-3  NASA needs an oversight process to statistically 
sample the work performed and documented by 
Alliance  technicians  to  ensure  process  control, 
compliance, and consistency.

10.6 ORBITER MAINTENANCE DOWN PERIOD/

ORBITER MAJOR MODIFICATION 

During  the  Orbiter  Major  Modification  process,  Orbiters 
are  removed  from  service  for  inspections,  maintenance, 
and modification. The process occurs every eight flights or 
three years. 

Orbiter  Major  Modifications  combine  with  Orbiter  flows 
(preparation  of  the  vehicle  for  its  next  mission)  and  in-
clude  Orbiter  Maintenance  Down  Periods  (not  every  Or-
biter Maintenance Down Period includes an Orbiter Major 
Modification). The primary differences between an Orbiter 
Major Modification and an Orbiter flow are the larger num-
ber of requirements and the greater degree of intrusiveness 
of a modification (a recent comparison showed 8,702 Or-
biter  Major  Modification  requirements  versus  3,826  flow 
requirements). 

Ten Orbiter Major Modifications have been performed to 
date, with an eleventh in progress. They have varied from 6 
to 20 months. Because missions do not occur at the rate the 
Shuttle Program anticipated at its inception, it is endlessly 
challenged to meet numerous calendar-based requirements. 
These  must  be  performed  regardless  of  the  lower  flight

rate, which contributes to extensive downtime. The Shuttle 
Program has explored the possibility of extending Orbiter 
Major Modification cycles to once every 12 flights or six 
years. This initiative runs counter to the industry norm of 
increasing the frequency of inspections as systems age, and 
should be carefully scrutinized, particularly in light of the 
high-performance Orbitersʼ demands. 

Orbiter  Major  Modifications  underwent  a  significant 
change  when  they  were  relocated  from  the  Boeing  facil-
ity in Palmdale, California, (where the Orbiters had been 
manufactured)  to  Kennedy  Space  Center  in  September 
2002. The major impetus for this change was budget short-
ages in Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003. The move capitalizes 
on many advantages at Kennedy, including lower labor and 
utility  costs  and  more  efficient  use  of  existing  overhead, 
while  eliminating  expensive,  underused,  and  redundant 
capabilities at Palmdale. However, the move also created 
new challenges: for instance, it complicates the integration 
of planning and scheduling, and forces the Space Shuttle 
Program to maintain a fluid workforce in which employees 
must repeatedly change tasks as they shift between Orbiter 
Major Modifications, flows, and downtime.

Throughout the history of Orbiter Major Modifications, a 
major area of concern has been their wide variability in con-
tent and duration. Columbiaʼs last Orbiter Major Modifica-
tion is just the most recent example of overruns due to tech-
nical surprises and management difficulties. It exceeded the 
schedule by 186 days. While many factors contributed to 
this delay, the two most prominent were the introduction 
of a major wiring inspection one month after Orbiter Major 
Modification  roll-in,  and  what  an  internal  NASA  assess-
ment  cited  as  “poor  performance  on  the  parts  of  NASA, 
USA [United Space Alliance], and Boeing.”

While the Shuttle Program has made efforts to correct these 
problems,  there  is  still  much  to  be  done.  The  transfer  to 
Kennedy creates a steep learning curve both for technicians 
and managers. Planning and scheduling the integration of 
all three Orbiters, as well as ground support systems main-
tenance, is critical to limit competition for resources. More-
over,  estimating  the  “right”  amount  of  work  required  on 
each Orbiter continues to be a challenge. For example, 20 
modifications were planned for  Discoveryʼs modification; 
the number has since grown to 84. Such changes introduce 
turmoil and increase the potential for mistakes. 

An  Air  Force  “benchmarking”  visit  in  June  2003  high-
lighted the need for better planning and more scheduling 
stability. It further recommended improvements to the re-
quirements feedback process and incorporating service life 
extension actions into Orbiter Major Modifications. 

Observations:

O10.6-1  The  Space  Shuttle  Program  Office  must  make 
every  effort  to  achieve  greater  stability,  con-
sistency,  and  predictability  in  Orbiter  Major 
Modification  planning,  scheduling,  and  work 
standards (particularly in the number of modi-
fications).  Endless  changes  create  unnecessary 

turmoil  and  can  adversely  impact  quality  and 
safety.

O10.6-2  NASA  and  United  Space  Alliance  managers 
must  understand  workforce  and  infrastructure 
requirements,  match  them  against  capabilities, 
and take actions to avoid exceeding thresholds.
O10.6-3  NASA should continue to work with the U.S. Air 
Force, particularly in areas of program manage-
ment that deal with aging systems, service life 
extension, planning and scheduling, workforce 
management, training, and quality assurance. 

O10.6-4  The Space Shuttle Program Office must deter-
mine how it will effectively meet the challenges 
of inspecting and maintaining an aging Orbiter 
fleet before lengthening Orbiter Major Mainte-
nance intervals. 

10.7 ORBITER CORROSION

Removing and replacing Thermal Protection System tiles 
sometimes results in damage to the anti-corrosion primer 
that covers the Orbitersʼ sheet metal skin. Tile replacement 
often occurs without first re-priming the primed aluminum 
substrate.  The  current  repair  practice  allows  Room  Tem-
perature  Vulcanizing  adhesive  to  be  applied  over  a  bare 
aluminum substrate (with no Koropon corrosion-inhibiting 
compound) when bonding tile to the Orbiter.

A  video  borescope  of  Columbia  prior  to  STS-107  found 
corrosion  on  the  lower  forward  fuselage  skin  panel  and 
stringer areas. Corrosion on visible rivets and on the sides 
and  feet  of  stringer  sections  was  also  uncovered  during 
borescope inspections, but was not repaired.

Other  corrosion  concerns  focus  on  the  area  between  the 
crew module and outer hull, which is a difficult area to ac-
cess for inspection and repair. At present, corrosion in this 
area is only monitored with borescope inspections. There is 
also concern that unchecked corrosion could progress from 
internal areas to external surfaces through fastener holes, 
joints, or directly through the skin. If this occurs beneath 
the tile, the tile system bond line could degrade.

Long-Term Corrosion Detection

Limited accessibility renders some corrosion damage dif-
ficult  to  detect. Approximately  90  percent  of  the  Orbiter 
structure (excluding the tile-covered outer mold line) can 
be inspected for corrosion.25 Corrosion in the remaining 10 
percent may remain undetected for the life of the vehicle.

NASA  has  recently  outlined  a  $70  million,  19-year  pro-
gram  to  assess  and  mitigate  corrosion.  The  agency  fore-
sees  inspection  intervals  based  on  trends  in  the  Problem 
Resolution  and  Corrective  Action  database,  exposure  to 
the  environment,  and  refurbishment  programs.  Develop-
ment of a correlation between corrosion initiation, growth, 
and environmental exposure requires the judicious use of 
long-term  test  data.  Moreover,  some  corrosion  problems 
are uncovered during non-corrosion inspections. The risk 
of undetected corrosion may increase as other inspections 
are removed or intervals between inspections are extended.

10.8 BRITTLE FRACTURE OF A-286 BOLTS

Investigators sought to determine the cause of brittle frac-
tures in the A-286 steel bolts that support the wingʼs lower 
carrier panels, which provide direct access to the interior of 
the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels. Any misalign-
ment of the carrier panels affects the continuity of airflow 
under  the  wing  and  can  cause  a  “rough  wing”  (see  Chap-
ter 4). In the end, 57 of the 88 A-286 bolts on Columbiaʼs 
wings  were  recovered;  22  had  brittle  fractures.  The  frac-
tures  occurred  equally  in  two  groups  of  bolts  in  the  same 
locations on each wing. Investigators determined that liquid 
metal embrittlement caused by aluminum vapor created by 
Columbiaʼs breakup could have contributed to these fractures, 
but the axial loads placed on the bolts when they separated 
from the carrier panel/box beam at temperatures approaching 
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit likely caused the failures. 

Findings:

F10.8-1  The present design and fabrication of the lower 
carrier  panel  attachments  are  inadequate.  The 
bolts can readily pull through the relatively large 
holes in the box beams.

F10.8-2  The current design of the box beam in the lower 
carrier  panel  assembly  exposes  the  attachment 
bolts to a rapid exchange of air along the wing, 
which enables the failure of numerous bolts. 
Primers and sealants such as Room Temperature 
Vulcanizing  560  and  Koropon  may  accelerate 
corrosion, particularly in tight crevices.

F10.8-4  The negligible compressive stresses that normally 
occur in A-286 bolts help protect against failure.

F10.8-3 

Observations:

O10.8-1  Teflon  (material)  and  Molybdenum  Disulfide 
(lubricant) should not be used in the carrier panel 
bolt assembly. 

O10.8-2  Galvanic coupling between aluminum and steel 

alloys must be mitigated. 

O10.8-3  The use of Room Temperature Vulcanizing 560 

and Koropon should be reviewed. 

O10.8-4  Assuring the continued presence of compressive 
stresses in A-286 bolts should be part of their ac-
ceptance and qualification procedures.

10.9 HOLD-DOWN POST CABLE ANOMALY

Each of the two Solid Rocket Boosters is attached to the 
Mobile Launch Platform by four “hold down” bolts. A five-
inch  diameter  restraint  nut  that  contains  two  pyrotechnic 
initiators secures each of these bolts. The initiators sever 
the nuts when the Solid Rocket Boosters ignite, allowing 
the Space Shuttle stack to lift off. During launch, STS-112 
suffered a failure in the Hold-Down Post and External Tank 
Vent Arm Systems that control the firing of initiators in each 
Solid Rocket Booster restraint nut. NASA had been warned 
that a recurrence of this type of failure could cause cata-
strophic failure of the Shuttle stack (see Appendix D.15).

The signal to fire the initiators begins in the General Pur-
pose  Computers  and  goes  to  both  of  the  Master  Events 
Controllers  on  the  Orbiter.  Master  Events  Controller  1 
communicates this signal to the A system cable, and Master 
Events Controller 2 feeds the B system. The cabling then 
goes  through  the  T–0  umbilical  (that  connects  fluid  and 
electrical  connections  between  the  launch  pad  and  the 
Orbiter) to the Pyrotechnics Initiator Controllers and then 
to the initiators. (There are 16 Pyrotechnics Initiator Con-
trollers for Hold Down Post Systems A and B, and four for 
the External Tank Vent Arm Systems A and B.) The Hold 
Down Post System A is hard-wired to one of the initiators 
on each of the four restraint nuts (eight total) while System 
B is hard-wired to the other initiator on each nut. The A and 
B systems also send a duplicate signal to the External Tank 
Vent Arm System. Either Master Events Controller will op-
erate if the other or the intervening cabling fails.

A post-launch review of STS-112 indicated that the System 
A  Hold-Down  Post  and  External Tank Vent Arm  System 
Pyrotechnics Initiator Controllers did not discharge. Initial 
troubleshooting  revealed  no  malfunction,  leading  to  the 
conclusion that the failure was intermittent. A subsequent 
investigation recommended the following:

•  All T–0  Ground  Cables  will  be  replaced  after  every 

•  The T–0 interface to the Pyrotechnics Initiator Con-

trollers rack cable (Kapton) is in redesign.

•  All  Orbiter  T–0  Connector  Savers  have  been  re-

flight.

placed.

•  Pyrotechnic connectors will be pre-screened with pin-
retention tests, and the connector saver mate process 
will be verified using videoscopes.

However,  prelaunch  testing  procedures  have  not  changed 
and may not be able to identify intermittent failures.

Findings:

F10.9-1  The  Hold-Down  Post  External  Tank  Vent Arm 
System  is  a  Criticality  1R  (redundant)  system. 
Before  the  anomaly  on  STS-112,  and  despite 
the  high-criticality  factor,  the  original  cabling 
for this system was used repeatedly until it was 
visibly damaged. Replacing these cables after ev-
ery flight and removing the Kapton will prevent 
bending and manipulation damage.

Visits to NASA facilities (both government and contractor 
operated,  as  well  as  contractor  facilities)  and  interviews 
with technicians revealed the use of 1970s-era oscilloscopes 
and other analog equipment. Currently available equipment 
is digital, and in other venues has proved to be less costly, 
easier to maintain, and more reliable and accurate. With the 
Shuttle  forecast  to  fly  through  2020,  an  upgrade  to  digital 
equipment would avoid the high maintenance, lack of parts, 
and  dubious  accuracy  of  equipment  currently  used.  New 
equipment  would  require  certification  for  its  uses,  but  the 
benefit  in  accuracy,  maintainability,  and  longevity  would 
likely outweigh the drawbacks of certification costs.

Observation:

O10.11-1  Assess NASA and contractor equipment to deter-
mine if an upgrade will provide the reliability and 
accuracy needed to maintain the Shuttle through 
2020.  Plan  an  aggressive  certification  program 
for replaced items so that new equipment can be 
put into operation as soon as possible.

10.12  LEADERSHIP/MANAGERIAL TRAINING 

Managers at many levels in NASA, from GS-14 to Associ-
ate Administrator,  have  taken  their  positions  without  fol-
lowing a recommended standard of training and education 
to prepare them for roles of increased responsibility. While 
NASA  has  a  number  of  in-house  academic  training  and 
career  development  opportunities,  the  timing  and  strategy 
for management and leadership development differs across 
organizations. Unlike other sectors of the Federal Govern-
ment  and  the  military,  NASA  does  not  have  a  standard 
agency-wide  career  planning  process  to  prepare  its  junior 
and mid-level managers for advanced roles. These programs 
range from academic fellowships to civil service education 
programs to billets in military-sponsored programs, and will 
allow NASA to build a strong corps of potential leaders for 
future progression.

Observation:

10.12-1  NASA should implement an agency-wide strat-
egy  for  leadership  and  management  training 
that  provides  a  more  consistent  and  integrated 
approach  to  career  development.  This  strategy 
should  identify  the  management  and  leadership 
skills, abilities, and experiences required for each 
level of advancement. NASA should continue to 
expand  its  leadership  development  partnerships 
with the Department of Defense and other exter-
nal organizations.

F10.9-2  NASA is unclear about the potential for damage 
if the system malfunctions, or even if one nut fails 
to split. Several program managers were asked: 
What if the A system fails, and a B-system initia-
tor fails simultaneously? The consensus was that 
the system would continue to burn on the pad or 
that the Solid Rocket Booster would rip free of 
the pad, causing potentially catastrophic damage 
to the Solid Rocket Booster skirt and nozzle ma-
neuvering mechanism. However, they agree that 
the probability of this is extremely low.

F10.9-3  With  the  exception  of  STS-112ʼs  anomaly,  nu-
merous  bolt  hang-ups,  and  occasional  Master 
Events Controller failures, these systems have a 
good record. In the early design stages, risk-miti-
gating options were considered, including strap-
ping with either a wire that crosses over the nut 
from the A to B side, or with a toggle circuit that 
sends a signal to the opposite side when either 
initiator fires. Both options would eliminate the 
potential of a catastrophic dual failure. However, 
they could also create new failure potentials that 
may not reduce overall system risk. Todayʼs test 
and  troubleshooting  technology  may  have  im-
proved the ability to test circuits and potentially 
prevent intermittent failures, but it is not clear if 
NASA has explored these options.

Observation:

O10.9-1   NASA should consider a redesign of the system, 
such as adding a cross-strapping cable, or con-
duct advanced testing for intermittent failure.
10.10  SOLID ROCKET BOOSTER EXTERNAL TANK 
 

   ATTACHMENT RING

In  Chapter  4,  the  Board  noted  how  NASAʼs  reliance  on 
“analysis”  to  validate  Shuttle  components  led  to  the  use 
of flawed bolt catchers. NASAʼs use of this flawed “analy-
sis” technique is endemic. The Board has found that such 
analysis was invoked, with potentially dire consequences, 
on  the  Solid  Rocket  Booster  External  Tank Attach  Ring. 
Tests  showed  that  the  tensile  strength  of  several  of  these 
rings was well below minimum safety requirements. This 
problem  was  brought  to  NASAʼs  attention  shortly  before 
the launch of STS-107. To accommodate the launch sched-
ule,  the  External  Tanking  Meeting  chair,  after  a  cursory 
briefing without a full technical review, reduced the Attach 
Ringsʼ minimum required safety factor of 1.4 (that is, able 
to withstand 1.4 times the maximum load ever expected in 
operations) to 1.25. Though NASA has formulated short-
and  long-term  corrections,  its  long-term  plan  has  not  yet 
been authorized. 

Observation:

O10.10-1  NASA should reinstate a safety factor of 1.4 for 
the  Attachment  Rings—which  invalidates  the 
use  of  ring  serial  numbers  16  and  15  in  their 
present state—and replace all deficient material 
in the Attachment Rings.

1  “And  stunningly,  in  as  much  as  this  was  tragic  and  horrific  through  a 
loss of seven very important lives, it is amazing that there were no other 
collateral damage happened as a result of it. No one else was injured. 
All of the claims have been very, very minor in dealing with these issues.” 
NASA Administrator Sean OʼKeefe, testimony before the United States 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, May 14, 
2003.

2  An  intensive  search  of  over  a  million  acres  in  Texas  and  Louisiana 
recovered 83,900 pieces of Columbia debris weighing a total of 84,900 
pounds. (Over 700,000 acres were searched on foot, and 1.6 million 
acres  were  searched  with  aircraft.)  The  latitude  and  longitude  was 
recorded  for  more  than  75,000  of  these  pieces.  The  majority  of  the 
recovered items were no larger than 0.5 square feet. More than 40,000 
items could not be positively identified but were classified as unknown 
tile,  metal,  composite,  plastic,  fabric,  etc.  Details  about  the  debris 
reconstruction  and  recovery  effort  are  provided  in  Appendix  E.5,  S.

3  The  precise  probability  is  uncertain  due  to  many  factors,  such  as  the 
amount of debris that burned up during re-entry, and the fraction of the 
population that was outdoors when the Columbia accident occurred.

7  Detailed  information  about  individual  fragments,  including  weight  in 
most cases, was not available for the study. Therefore, some engineering 
discretion  was  needed  to  develop  models  of  individual  weights, 
dimensions, aerodynamic characteristics, and conditions of impact. This 
lack  of  information  increases  uncertainty  in  the  accuracy  of  the  final 
results. The study should be revisited after the fragment data has been 
fully characterized.

CHAPTER 11

Recommendations

It  is  the  Boardʼs  opinion  that  good  leadership  can  direct 
a  culture  to  adapt  to  new  realities.  NASAʼs  culture  must 
change, and the Board intends the following recommenda-
tions to be steps toward effecting this change.

Recommendations have been put forth in many of the chap-
ters. In this chapter, the recommendations are grouped by 
subject  area  with  the  Return-to-Flight  [RTF]  tasks  listed 
first within the subject area. Each Recommendation retains 
its number so the reader can refer to the related section for 
additional details. These recommendations are not listed in 
priority order.

PART ONE – THE ACCIDENT 

Thermal Protection System

R3.2-1  

R3.3-2  

R3.3-1 

R6.4-1  

Initiate  an  aggressive  program  to  eliminate  all 
External Tank Thermal Protection System debris-
shedding at the source with particular emphasis 
on the region where the bipod struts attach to the 
External Tank. 
[RTF]

Initiate  a  program  designed  to  increase  the 
Orbiterʼs ability to sustain minor debris damage 
by  measures  such  as  improved  impact-resistant 
Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  and  acreage  tiles. 
This program should determine the actual impact 
resistance of current materials and the effect of 
likely debris strikes. 
[RTF]

Develop and implement a comprehensive inspec-
tion plan to determine the structural integrity of 
all  Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  system  compo-
nents. This inspection plan should take advantage 
of advanced non-destructive inspection technol-
ogy. 
[RTF]  

For missions to the International Space Station, 
develop  a  practicable  capability  to  inspect  and 
effect  emergency  repairs  to  the  widest  possible 
range of damage to the Thermal Protection Sys-
tem, including both tile and Reinforced Carbon-

 

 

 
 

R3.3-3  

R3.3-4 

Carbon, taking advantage of the additional capa-
bilities available when near to or docked at the 
International Space Station.  
 
 
For non-Station missions, develop a comprehen-
sive autonomous (independent of Station) inspec-
tion  and  repair  capability  to  cover  the  widest 
possible range of damage scenarios. 

Accomplish  an  on-orbit  Thermal  Protection 
System inspection, using appropriate assets and 
capabilities, early in all missions. 

The ultimate objective should be a fully autono-
mous  capability  for  all  missions  to  address  the 
possibility  that  an  International  Space  Station 
mission fails to achieve the correct orbit, fails to 
dock successfully, or is damaged during or after 
undocking. 
 [RTF]

To the extent possible, increase the Orbiterʼs abil-
ity  to  successfully  re-enter  Earthʼs  atmosphere 
with  minor  leading  edge  structural  sub-system 
damage.

In order to understand the true material character-
istics of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon components, 
develop a comprehensive database of flown Rein-
forced Carbon-Carbon material characteristics by 
destructive testing and evaluation.

R3.3-5 

Improve  the  maintenance  of  launch  pad  struc-
tures  to  minimize  the  leaching  of  zinc  primer 
onto Reinforced Carbon-Carbon components.

R3.8-1   Obtain  sufficient  spare  Reinforced  Carbon-Car-
bon  panel  assemblies  and  associated  support 
components  to  ensure  that  decisions  on  Rein-
forced  Carbon-Carbon  maintenance  are  made 
on the basis of component specifications, free of 
external pressures relating to schedules, costs, or 
other considerations.

A C C I D E N T   I N V E S T I G A T I O N   B O A R D

R3.8-2   Develop,  validate,  and  maintain  physics-based 
computer  models  to  evaluate  Thermal  Protec-
tion System damage from debris impacts. These 
tools  should  provide  realistic  and  timely  esti-
mates of any impact damage from possible de-
bris from any source that may ultimately impact 
the Orbiter. Establish impact damage thresholds 
that trigger responsive corrective action, such as 
on-orbit inspection and repair, when indicated.

Imaging

R3.4-1 

R3.4-2  

R3.4-3  

Upgrade  the  imaging  system  to  be  capable  of 
providing a minimum of three useful views of 
the  Space  Shuttle  from  liftoff  to  at  least  Solid 
Rocket Booster separation, along any expected 
ascent azimuth. The operational status of these 
assets should be included in the Launch Com-
mit Criteria for future launches. Consider using 
ships or aircraft to provide additional views of 
the Shuttle during ascent. 
[RTF] 

Provide  a  capability  to  obtain  and  downlink 
high-resolution  images  of  the  External  Tank 
after it separates. 
[RTF]

Provide  a  capability  to  obtain  and  downlink 
high-resolution images of the underside of the 
Orbiter wing leading edge and forward section 
of both wingsʼ Thermal Protection System. 
 
 

[RTF]

R6.3-2  Modify  the  Memorandum  of  Agreement  with 
the  National  Imagery  and  Mapping Agency  to 
make the imaging of each Shuttle flight while on 
orbit a standard requirement. 
[RTF]

 

Orbiter Sensor Data

R3.6-1   The Modular Auxiliary Data System instrumen-
tation and sensor suite on each Orbiter should be 
maintained and updated to include current sen-
sor and data acquisition technologies.

R3.6-2   The Modular Auxiliary Data System should be 
redesigned to include engineering performance 
and  vehicle  health  information,  and  have  the 
ability to be reconfigured during flight in order 
to allow certain data to be recorded, telemetered, 
or both as needs change. 

Wiring

R4.2-2   As  part  of  the  Shuttle  Service  Life  Extension 
Program  and  potential  40-year  service  life, 
develop  a  state-of-the-art  means  to  inspect  all 
Orbiter wiring, including that which is inacces-
sible.

Bolt Catchers

R4.2-1   Test and qualify the flight hardware bolt catch-
[RTF]

ers.  

Closeouts

R4.2-3 

Require  that  at  least  two  employees  attend  all 
final closeouts and intertank area hand-spraying 
[RTF]
procedures. 

Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris

R4.2-4   Require the Space Shuttle to be operated with 
the  same  degree  of  safety  for  micrometeoroid 
and orbital debris as the degree of safety calcu-
lated for the International Space Station. Change 
the micrometeoroid and orbital debris safety cri-
teria from guidelines to requirements.

Foreign Object Debris

R4.2-5   Kennedy  Space  Center  Quality  Assurance 
and  United  Space Alliance  must  return  to  the 
straightforward, industry-standard definition of 
“Foreign Object Debris” and eliminate any al-
ternate or statistically deceptive definitions like 
“processing debris.”  
[RTF]

PART TWO – WHY THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED

Scheduling

R6.2-1 

Training

R6.3-1 

Adopt  and  maintain  a  Shuttle  flight  schedule 
that  is  consistent  with  available  resources. 
Although  schedule  deadlines  are  an  important 
management  tool,  those  deadlines  must  be 
regularly evaluated to ensure that any additional 
risk incurred to meet the schedule is recognized, 
understood, and acceptable.  
[RTF]

Implement  an  expanded  training  program  in 
which  the  Mission  Management  Team  faces 
potential crew and vehicle safety contingencies 
beyond launch and ascent. These contingencies 
should involve potential loss of Shuttle or crew, 
contain numerous uncertainties and unknowns, 
and  require  the  Mission  Management Team  to 
assemble  and  interact  with  support  organiza-
tions across NASA/Contractor lines and in vari-
ous locations.

requirements and all waivers to them, and will 
build  a  disciplined,  systematic  approach  to 
identifying,  analyzing,  and  controlling  hazards 
throughout the life cycle of the Shuttle System. 
The independent technical authority does the fol-
lowing as a minimum: 

•  Develop and maintain technical standards 
for all Space Shuttle Program projects and 
elements

•  Be the sole waiver-granting authority for 

all technical standards

•  Conduct trend and risk analysis at the sub-

system, system, and enterprise levels

•  Own the failure mode, effects analysis and 

hazard reporting systems

•  Conduct integrated hazard analysis
•  Decide  what  is  and  is  not  an  anomalous 

•  Independently verify launch readiness
•  Approve the provisions of the recertifica-
tion program called for in Recommenda-
tion R9.1-1.

event

Recertification

R9.2-1 

Prior  to  operating  the  Shuttle  beyond  2010, 
develop and conduct a vehicle recertification at 
the material, component, subsystem, and system 
levels.  Recertification  requirements  should  be 
included in the Service Life Extension Program.

Closeout Photos/Drawing System

R10.3-1  Develop  an  interim  program  of  closeout  pho-
tographs for all critical sub-systems that differ 
from engineering drawings. Digitize the close-
out photograph system so that images are imme-
diately available for on-orbit troubleshooting.    
 
[RTF]

R10.3-2  Provide adequate resources for a long-term pro-
gram to upgrade the Shuttle engineering draw-
ing system including:

•  Reviewing drawings for accuracy
•  Converting  all  drawings  to  a  computer-

aided drafting system

•  Incorporating engineering changes

 

R7.5-2 

R7.5-3 

The Technical Engineering Authority should be 
funded directly from NASA Headquarters, and 
should have no connection to or responsibility 
for schedule or program cost. 

NASA Headquarters Office of Safety and Mis-
sion Assurance should have direct line authority 
over  the  entire  Space  Shuttle  Program  safety 
organization  and  should  be  independently  re-
sourced.

Reorganize the Space Shuttle Integration Office 
to make it capable of integrating all elements of 
the  Space  Shuttle  Program,  including  the  Or-
biter.

PART THREE – A LOOK AHEAD 

Organization

R9.1-1 

Prepare a detailed plan for defining, establishing, 
transitioning, and implementing an independent 
Technical  Engineering  Authority,  independent 
safety program, and a reorganized Space Shuttle 
Integration Office as described in R7.5-1, R7.5-
2, and R7.5-3. In addition, NASA should submit 
annual reports to Congress, as part of the budget 
review  process,  on  its  implementation  activi-

The Investigation

A.1  ACTIVATION OF THE
 

COLUMBIA ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD

At 8:59:32 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday, February 
1, 2003, communication with the Shuttle Columbia was lost. 
Shortly after the planned landing time of 9:16 a.m., NASA 
declared  a  Shuttle  Contingency  and  executed  the  Agency 
Contingency Action  Plan  for  Space  Flight  Operations  that 
had been established after the Space Shuttle Challenger ac-
cident in January 1986. As part of that plan, NASA Adminis-
trator Sean OʼKeefe deployed NASAʼs Mishap Investigation 
Team, activated the Headquarters Contingency Action Team, 
and, at 10:30 a.m., activated the International Space Station 
and Space Shuttle Mishap Interagency Investigation Board. 

The International Space Station and Space Shuttle Mishap 
Interagency Investigation Board is designated in Appendix 
D  of  the Agency  Contingency Action  Plan  as  an  external 
investigating board that works to uncover the “facts, as well 
as the actual or probable causes of the Shuttle mishap” and 
to “recommend preventative and other appropriate actions 
to preclude the recurrence of a similar mishap.”1 The Board 
is composed of seven members and is chartered with provi-
sions for naming a Chairman and additional members. The 
seven  members  take  their  position  on  the  Board  because 
they occupy specific government posts. At the time of the 
accident, these individuals included:

•  Chief of Safety, U.S. Air Force: Major General Kenneth 

W. Hess

•  Director,  Office  of  Accident  Investigation,  Federal 

Aviation Administration: Steven B. Wallace

•  Representative, U.S. Air Force Space Command: Briga-

dier General Duane W. Deal

•  Commander,  Naval  Safety  Center:  Rear Admiral  Ste-

phen A. Turcotte

•  Director,  Aviation  Safety  Division,  Volpe  National 
Transportation  Systems  Center,  Department  of Trans-
portation: Dr. James N. Hallock

•  Representative,  U.S.  Air  Force  Materiel  Command: 

Major General John L. Barry

•  Director, NASA Field Center or NASA Program Asso-

ciate Administrator (not related to mission): Vacant

Upon activating the Board, Administrator OʼKeefe named 
Admiral  Harold  W.  Gehman  Jr.,  United  States  Navy  (re-
tired), as its Chair, and G. Scott Hubbard, Director of NASA 
Ames Research Center, as the NASA Field Center Director 
representative. In addition to these eight voting members, 
contingency procedures provided for adding two non-vot-
ing NASA representatives, who helped establish the Board 
during the first weeks of activity but then returned to their 
regular duties. They were Bryan D. OʼConnor, NASA Asso-
ciate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance, who 
served as an ex-officio Member of the Board, and Theron 
M. Bradley Jr., NASA Chief Engineer, who served as the 
Boardʼs Executive Secretary. Upon the Boardʼs activation, 
two  NASA  officials,  David  Lengyel  and  Steven  Schmidt, 
were  dispatched  to  provide  for  the  Boardʼs  administra-
tive needs. J. William Sikora, Chief Counsel of the Glenn 
Research  Center  in  Cleveland,  Ohio,  was  assigned  as  the 
counsel to the Board.

By noon on February 1, NASA officials notified most Board 
members of the mishap and issued tentative orders for the 
Board to convene the next day at Barksdale Air Force Base 
in Shreveport, Louisiana, where the NASA Mishap Investi-
gation Team was coordinating the search for debris. At 5:00 
p.m., available Board members participated in a teleconfer-
ence with NASAʼs Headquarters Contingency Action Team. 
During  that  teleconference,  Gehman  proposed  that  the 
International Space Station and Space Shuttle Mishap Inter-
agency Investigation Board be renamed the Columbia Acci-
dent Investigation Board. OʼKeefe accepted this change and 
formally chartered the Board on Sunday, February 2, 2003.

On Sunday, Board members flew on government and com-
mercial aircraft to Barksdale Air Force Base, where at 6:50 
p.m. Central Standard Time the Board held its first official 
meeting. The Board initiated its investigation on Monday, 
February 3, at 8:00 a.m. Central Standard Time. On Tuesday 
morning,  February  4,  the  Board  toured  the  debris  field  in 
and  around  Nacogdoches, Texas,  and  observed  a  moment 
of silence. On Thursday, February 6, the Board relocated to 
the Johnson Space Center, eventually settling into its own 
offices off Center grounds. That evening, the Board formally 
relieved the NASA Headquarters Contingency Action Team

of its interim responsibilities for initial accident investiga-
tion  activities.  The  Board  assumed  operational  control  of 
the debris search and recovery efforts from NASAʼs Mishap 
Investigation Team, which functioned under the Boardʼs di-
rection until the completion of the search in early May.
A.2  BOARD CHARTER AND
 

ORGANIZATION

During meetings that first week, Chairman Gehman and the 
Board  proposed  that  its  charter  be  rewritten. The  original 
charter, derived from Appendix D of NASAʼs Contingency 
Action Plan, had a number of internal inconsistencies and 
provisions that the Board believed would impede the execu-
tion of its duties. Additionally, the Board was not satisfied 
that its initial charter adequately ensured independence from 
NASA. The Board resolved to: 

•  Have its own administrative and technical staff so that 
it could independently conduct testing and analysis and 
establish facts and conclusions

•  Secure an adequate and independent budget to be over-

seen by the Board Chairman

•  Establish and maintain records independent from NASA 

records

Members

•  Empower  the  Board  Chairman  to  appoint  new  Board 

•  Provide the public with detailed updates on the progress 
of  its  investigation  through  frequent  public  hearings, 
press briefings, and by immediately releasing all signifi-
cant information, with the exception of details relating 
to the death of the crew members and privileged witness 
statements taken under the condition of confidentiality
•  Simultaneously release its report to Congress, the White 

House, NASA, the public, and the astronautsʼ families

•  Allow Board members to voice any disagreements with 

Board conclusions in minority reports 

With  the  full  cooperation  of  Administrator  OʼKeefe,  the 
Boardʼs  charter  was  rewritten  to  incorporate  these  prin-
ciples. The new charter, which underwent three drafts, was 
signed  and  ratified  by  OʼKeefe  on  February  18,  2003.  In 
re-chartering the Board, OʼKeefe waived the requirements 
specified in the Contingency Action Plan that the Board use 
standard NASA mishap investigation procedures and instead 
authorized the Board to pursue “whatever avenue you deem 
appropriate” to conduct the investigation.2 
Additional Board Members

To manage its burgeoning investigative responsibilities, the 
Board added additional members, each of whom brought to 
the Board a needed area of expertise. On February 6, the 
Board  appointed  Roger  E.  Tetrault,  retired  Chairman  and 
Chief  Executive  Officer  of  McDermott  International.  On 
February 15, the Board appointed Sheila E. Widnall, Ph.D., 
Institute Professor and Professor of Aeronautics and Astro-
nautics  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  and 
former Secretary of the Air Force. On March 5, the Board 
appointed Douglas D. Osheroff, Ph.D., Nobel Laureate in 
Physics and Chair of the Stanford Physics Department; Sally 
K. Ride, Ph.D., Professor of Space Science at the University 

of California at San Diego and the nationʼs first woman in 
space; and John M. Logsdon, Ph.D., Director of the Space 
Policy  Institute  at  George  Washington  University.  This 
brought the total number of Board members to 13, coinci-
dentally the same number as the Presidential Commission 
on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. 

Board Organization 

In the first week, the Board divided into four groups, each of 
which addressed separate areas of the investigation. Group 
I, consisting of General Barry, General Deal, and Admiral 
Turcotte,  examined  NASA  management  and  treatment  of 
materials,  including  Shuttle  maintenance  safety  and  mis-
sion assurance. Group II, consisting of General Hess, Mr. 
Wallace,  and  later  Dr.  Ride,  scrutinized  NASA  training, 
operations, and the in-flight performance of ground crews 
and the Shuttle crew. Group III, consisting of Dr. Hallock, 
Mr. Hubbard, and later Mr. Tetrault, Dr. Widnall, and Dr. 
Osheroff, focused on engineering and technical analysis of 
the accident and resulting debris. Group IV, consisting of Dr. 
Logsdon, Dr. Ride, and Mr. Hubbard, examined how NASA 
history, budget, and institutional culture affected the opera-
tion of the Space Shuttle Program. Each group, with the ap-
proval of the Chairman, hired investigators and support staff 
and collaborated extensively with one another.

The Board also organized an internal staff of technical ex-
perts called the Independent Assessment Team. Under the 
leadership  of  James  Mosquera,  a  senior  nuclear  engineer 
with the U. S. Navy, the Independent Assessment Team ad-
vised the Board when and where NASA analysis should be 
independently verified and, when needed, conducted fully 
independent tests on the Boardʼs behalf. 
A.3  INVESTIGATION PROCESS AND SCOPE

Decision to Pursue a Safety Investigation

During the first week of its investigation, the Board reviewed 
the structure and methodology of the Presidential Commis-
sion on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, the Interna-
tional Civil Aviation Organization standards used by the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation 
Administration, and the accident investigation models under 
which the U.S. Air Force and Navy Safety Centers operate. 
Rather than assign formal blame or determine legal liability 
for the cause of the accident, the Board affirmed its charge to 
pursue both an accident investigation and a safety investiga-
tion, the primary aim of which would be to identify and cor-
rect threats to the safe operation of the Space Shuttle. 

The Use of Privileged Witness Statements 

With a principal focus on identifying and correcting threats 
to safe operations, safety investigations place a premium on 
obtaining full and complete disclosure about every aspect of 
an accident, even if that information may prove damaging 
or embarrassing to particular individuals or organizations. 
However,  individuals  who  have  made  mistakes,  know  of 
negligence by others, or suspect potential flaws in their or-
ganizations are often afraid of being fired or even prosecuted 

2 3 2

if they speak out. To allay these fears, which can prevent the 
emergence of information that could save lives in the future, 
many safety investigations, including those by NASA and 
by the Air Force and Navy Safety Centers, grant witnesses 
complete confidentiality, as do internal affairs investigations 
by  agency  Inspector  Generals. This  confidentiality,  which 
courts  recognize  as  “privileged  communication,”  allows 
witnesses  to  volunteer  information  that  they  would  not 
otherwise provide and to speculate more openly about their 
organizationsʼ flaws than they would in a public forum.

Given the stakes of the Columbia accident investigation, the 
most important being the lives of future astronauts, the Board 
decided to extend witnesses confidentiality, even though this 
confidentiality  would  necessitate  that  investigators  redact 
some witness information before releasing it to the public.

Consistent with NASA Safety Program policy NPD 8621.1H 
Para 1.j, statements made to Board investigators under privi-
lege were not made under legal oath. Investigators recorded 
and then transcribed interviews, with those interviewed af-
firming by their signatures the accuracy of the transcripts. 
The  Board  took  extraordinary  measures  to  ensure  that 
privileged witness statements would remain confidential by 
restricting access to these statements to its 13 members and 
a small number of authorized support staff. Witness state-
ments and information derived from them are exempt from 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The existence of a safety investigation in which privileged 
statements are taken does not prevent an accounting of per-
sonal responsibility associated with an accident. It merely 
means that such an accounting must result from a separate 
investigation. In this instance, that responsibility has been 
left to the NASA administration and the Congressional com-
mittees that oversee the agency. To facilitate this separate 
investigation, the Board pledged to notify NASA and Con-
gress if evidence of criminal activity or willful negligence is 
found in privileged statements or elsewhere. Additionally, 
the Board opened all its files to Congressional representa-
tives, with the exception of privileged witness statements. 
Limited  Congressional  access  to  these  statements  is  gov-
erned by a special written agreement between the oversight 
committees and the Board that preserves the Boardʼs obliga-
tion to witnesses who have entrusted them with information 
on the condition of confidentiality.

Expanded Bounds of Board Investigation

Throughout the investigation, Chairman Gehman consulted 
regularly with members of Congress and the Administration 
to ensure that the Board met its responsibilities to provide 
the public with a full and open accounting of the Columbia 
accident. At the request of Congressional Oversight Com-
mittees, the Board significantly expanded the scope of its 
investigation to include a broad review of the Space Shuttle 
Program since its inception. In addition to establishing the 
accidentʼs probable and contributing causes, the Boardʼs re-
port is intended to serve as the basis for an extended public 
policy  debate  over  the  future  course  of  the  Space  Shuttle 
Program  and  the  role  it  will  play  in  the  nationʼs  manned 
space flight program.

A.4  BOARD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Authorizing Investigators

To maintain control over the investigation process, the Chair-
man established a system of written authorizations specify-
ing individuals who were sanctioned to interview witnesses 
or perform other functions on behalf of the Board. 

Consideration of Federal Advisory Committee Act 
Statutes

Not long after its activation, and well before adding addi-
tional members, the Board considered the applicability of 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act.3 This statute requires 
advisory committees established by the President or a fed-
eral agency to provide formal public notice of their meet-
ings as well as public access to their deliberations. In con-
trast to most committees governed by the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act, which meet a few times per year, the Board 
intended from the outset to conduct a full-time, fast-paced 
investigation,  in  which  Board  members  themselves  were 
active  investigators  who  would  shape  the  investigationʼs 
direction  as  it  developed.  The  Board  concluded  that  the 
formalities  required  by  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee 
Act are not compatible with the kind of investigation it was 
charged  to  complete.  Nor  did  the  Board  find  the  Federal 
Advisory Committee Act statutes compatible with exercis-
ing operational responsibility for more than a hundred staff 
and thousands of debris searchers. 

Though the Federal Advisory Committee Act did not apply 
to the Boardʼs activities, the Board resolved to be faithful to 
the standards of openness the Act embodies. The Board held 
frequent press briefings and public hearings, released all sig-
nificant findings immediately, and maintained a telephone 
hotline  and  a  Web  site,  where  users  accessed  Web  pages 
more  than  40,000,000  times.  The  Board  also  processed 
Freedom  of  Information Act  requests  according  to  proce-
dures established in 14 C.F.R. Section 1206.

Board Members as Federal Employees

The  possibility  of  litigation  against  Board  members  for 
their  actions  while  on  the  Board,  especially  because  the 
Space  Flight  Operations  Contract  would  be  a  subject  of 
investigation, made it necessary to bring Board Members 
within the protections that the Federal Tort Claims Act af-
fords to federal employees. This and other considerations 
led the Board Chairman to determine that the Board should 
consist  of  full-time  federal  employees. As  the  Chairman 
named new Board members, the NASA Administrator hon-
ored the Boardʼs determination and deemed them full-time 
federal employees. 

Oversight of Board Activities

To ensure that the Board acted in an independent and unbi-
ased manner in its investigation, the NASA Inspector Gener-
al was admitted on request to any Board proceeding, except 
those  involving  privileged  witness  statements.  The  Board 
also allowed Congressional access to the Boardʼs databases

and offices in Houston and Washington, D.C., with special 
restrictions that preserved the integrity and confidentiality of 
privileged witness statements.

Financial Independence

To ensure the Boardʼs financial independence, NASA estab-
lished a separate operating budget for the Boardʼs activities. 
This fund provided for Board operating expenses, including 
extensive testing and analysis and the acquisition of services 
by support staff and technical experts. With the exception 
of Chairman Gehman, whose salary was paid by the Office 
of Personnel Management, and those Board members who 
were  already  federal  government  or  military  employees, 
Board members were compensated by Congressionally ap-
propriated funds administered by NASA.

Board Staffing and Administrative Support

Through a Government Services Administration-supervised 
bidding  process, Valador,  Inc.,  a  service-disabled-veteran-
owned  professional  services  contractor,  was  selected  to 
provide  the  Boardʼs  administrative  and  technical  support. 
Under  a  Mission  Operation  and  Business  Improvement 
Systems contract, Valador arranged for the Boardʼs support 
staff, technical experts, and information technology needs, 
including the Board Web site, http://www.caib.us. Valador 
also  supported  the  Boardʼs  public  hearings,  press  confer-
ences, the public-input database, and the publication of the 
final report.

The  Board  was  aided  by  public  affairs  officers;  a  budget 
manager; representatives from the National Transportation 
Safety  Board,  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency, 
Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice Civil 
Division,  Office  of  Litigation  Support;  and  Dr.  James  B. 
Bagian, an astronaut flight surgeon assigned from the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs who worked with the NASA 
medical staff, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and the 
local medical examiner. A complete list of staff and consul-
tants appears in Appendix B.2 and B.3.

Public Inputs

The Board established a system for inputs from the public 
that included a 24-hour hotline, mailing address, and online 
comment form linked to the Boardʼs Web site. This enabled 
the submission of photographs, comments, technical papers, 
and other materials by the public, some of whom made sub-
missions anonymously. Board staff logged every input into 
a database. To establish the relevance of every phone call, 
letter,  e-mail,  or  online  comment,  investigators  evaluated 
their significance and, if appropriate, followed up with the 
submitters.  Of  the  3,000  submissions  the  Board  received, 
more  than  750  resulted  in  actions  by  one  of  the  Boardʼs 
four investigative sub-groups, the Independent Assessment 
Team, or other Board staff.

Office of Governmental Affairs

As  inquiries  from  Congress  grew  and  the  need  to  keep 
the  Executive  and  Legislative  branches  updated  on  the 

investigationʼs progress became clear, the Board opened an 
Office of Governmental Affairs. Based in Washington, D.C., 
it served as the Boardʼs liaison to the White House, depart-
ments within the Executive Branch, Congressional Oversight 
Committees, and members of Congress and their staffs. The 
office conducted numerous briefings, responded to Congres-
sional inquiries, and ensured that the investigation met the 
needs of the Congressional Oversight Committees that plan 
to use the Boardʼs report as the basis for a public policy de-
bate on the future of the Space Shuttle Program.
A.5  INVESTIGATION INTERFACE WITH NASA

NASA mobilized hundreds of personnel to directly support 
the Boardʼs investigation on a full-time basis. Initially, as 
part of the Contingency Action Plan activated on February 
1,  the  Mishap  Investigation  Team  went  to  Barksdale  Air 
Force Base to coordinate the search for debris. NASA then 
deployed a Mishap Response Team to begin an engineering 
analysis of the accident. These groups consisted of Space 
Shuttle Program personnel and outside experts from NASA 
and contractor facilities.

As prescribed by its charter, the Board coordinated its in-
vestigation with NASA through a NASA Task Force Team, 
later designated the Columbia Task Force. This group was 
the  liaison  between  the  Board  and  the  Mishap  Response 
Team. As the investigation progressed, NASA modified the 
organizational  structure  of  the  Mishap  Response  Team  to 
more  closely  align  with  Board  structure  and  investigative 
paths, and NASA renamed it the NASA Accident Investiga-
tion Team. This team supported the Boardʼs investigation, 
along with thousands of other NASA and contract personnel 
who worked in the fault tree teams described in Chapter 4 
and on the debris search efforts described in Chapter 2.

Documents and Actions Requested From NASA

The close coordination of the NASA Investigation Team with 
the Boardʼs sub-groups required a system for tracking docu-
ments and actions requested by the investigation. The Board 
and the Columbia Task Force each appointed representatives 
to track documents and manage their configuration.

Board  investigators  submitted  more  than  600  requests  for 
action or information from NASA. Requests were submitted 
in writing, on a standardized form,4 and signed by a Board 
member. Only Board members were authorized to sign such 
requests. Each request was given a priority and tracked in a 
database. Once answered by Columbia Task Force person-
nel,  the  Board  member  who  submitted  the  request  either 
noted by signature that the response was satisfactory or re-
submitted the request for further action.

Reassignment of Certain NASA Personnel Involved 
in STS-107

On February 25, 2003, Chairman Gehman wrote to NASA 
Administrator  OʼKeefe,  asking  that  he  “reassign  the  top 
level  Space  Shuttle  Program  management  personnel  who 
were involved in the preparation and operation of the flight 
of STS-107 back to their duties and remove them from di-

2 3 4

rectly managing or supporting the investigation.”5 This letter 
expressed the Boardʼs desire to prevent actual or perceived 
conflicts of interest between NASA personnel and the inves-
tigation. In response, OʼKeefe reassigned several members 
of NASAʼs Columbia Task Force and Mishap Investigation 
Team and reorganized it along the same lines as the Boardʼs 
groups. Additionally, Bryan OʼConnor, an Ex-Officio Mem-
ber to the Board, and Theron Bradley Jr., the Boardʼs Execu-
tive Secretary, returned to their respective duties as Associate 
Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance and Chief 
Engineer, and were not replaced. After OʼConnorʼs depar-
ture,  Colonel  (Selectee)  Michael  J.  Bloomfield,  an  active 
Shuttle Commander and the lead training astronaut, joined 
the Board as a representative from the Astronaut Office.

Handling of Debris and Impounded Materials

To ensure that all material associated with Columbiaʼs mis-
sion was preserved as evidence in the investigation, NASA 
officials impounded data, software, hardware, and facilities 
at NASA and contractor sites. At the Johnson Space Center 
in Houston, Texas, the door to the Mission Control Center 
was  locked  while  flight  control  personnel  created  and  ar-
chived backup copies of all original mission data and took 
statements  from  Mission  Control  personnel.  At  the  Ken-
nedy Space Center in Florida, mission facilities and related 
hardware, including Launch Pad Complex 39-A, were put 
under guard or stored in secure warehouses. Similar steps 
were taken at other key Shuttle facilities, including the Mar-
shall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the 
Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, Louisiana. 
Impounded  items  and  data  were  released  only  when  the 
Board Chairman approved a formal request from the NASA 
Columbia Task Force.

Similarly, any testing performed on Shuttle debris was ap-
proved by the Board Chairman only after the Columbia Task 
Force provided a written request outlining the potential ben-
efits of the testing and addressing any possible degradation of 
the debris that could affect the investigation. When testing of 
Shuttle debris or hardware occurred outside the secure debris 
hanger at the Kennedy Space Center, investigation personnel 
escorted the debris for the duration of the testing process or 
otherwise ensured the itemsʼ integrity and security.
A.6  BOARD DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM 

The Columbia Accident Investigation Board 
Database Server

The sheer volume of documentation and research generated 
in the investigation required an electronic repository capable 
of storing hundreds of thousands of pages of technical in-
formation, briefing charts, hearing transcripts, government 
documents,  witness  statements,  public  inputs,  and  corre-
spondence related to the Columbia accident.

For the first few months of its investigation, the Board used 
the  Process-Based  Mission  Assurance  (PBMA)  system 
for many of its documentation needs. This Web-based ac-
tion tracking and document management system, which is 
hosted  on  a  server  at  the  NASA  Glenn  Research  Center, 

was  developed  and  maintained  by  NASA Ames  Research 
Center. The PBMA system was established as a repository 
for all data provided by NASA in response to the Boardʼs 
Action/Request for Information process. It contained all in-
formation produced by the Columbia Task Force, as well as 
reports from NASA and other external groups, presentations 
to the Board, signed hardware release and test release forms, 
images, and schedule information.

However,  the  PBMA  system  had  several  critical  limita-
tions  that  eventually  compelled  the  Board  to  establish  its 
own server and databases. First, NASA owned the Mission 
Assurance  system  and  was  responsible  for  the  documents 
it produced. The Board, seeking to maintain independence 
from NASA and the Columbia Task Force, found it unac-
ceptable to keep its documentation on what was ultimately a 
NASA database. Second, the PBMA system is not full-text 
searchable,  and  did  not  allow  investigators  to  efficiently 
cross-reference documents. 

The Board wanted access to all the documents produced by 
the Columbia Task Force, while simultaneously maintaining 
its  own  secure  and  independent  databases. To  accomplish 
this, the Board secured the assistance of the Department of 
Justice Civil Division, Office of Litigation Support, which 
established the Columbia Accident Investigation Board Da-
tabase Server. This server provided access to four document 
databases:

•  Columbia Task Force Database: all the data in NASAʼs 
Process-Based Mission Assurance system, though inde-
pendent from it. 

•  Columbia Accident Investigation Board Document Da-
tabase: all documents gathered or generated by Board 
members, investigators, and support staff.

•  Interview Database: all transcriptions of privileged wit-

ness interviews.

•  Investigation  Meeting  Minutes  Database:  text  of  ap-

proved Board meeting minutes.

Although the Board had access to the Process-Based Mis-
sion Assurance system and therefore every document cre-
ated by the Columbia Task Force, the Task Force did not 
have  access  to  any  of  the  Boardʼs  documents  that  were 
independently produced in the Boardʼs four other databases. 
A security system allowed Board members to access these 
databases through the Boardʼs Database Server using confi-
dential IDs and passwords. In total, the Columbia Accident 
Investigation  Board  Database  Server  housed  more  than 
450,000 pages that comprised more than 75,000 documents. 
The bulk of these are from NASAʼs Columbia Task Force 
Document  Database,  which  holds  over  45,000  documents 
totaling 270,000 pages. 

To  ensure  that  all  documents  received  and  generated  by 
individual investigators became part of the permanent Co-
lumbia Accident  Investigation  Board  archive,  Department 
of Justice contractors had coordinators in each investigative 
group who gathered electronic or hard copies of all relevant 
investigation  documents  for  inclusion  in  the  Columbia 
Accident  Investigation  Board  Document  Database.  Every 
page of hard copy received a unique tracking number, was

imaged, converted to a digital format, and loaded onto the 
server.  Documents  submitted  electronically  were  saved  in 
Adobe  PDF  format  and  endorsed  with  a  tracking  number 
on each page. Where relevant, these document numbers are 
referenced in citations found in this report. The Columbia 
Accident Investigation Board Document database contains 
more than 30,000 documents comprising 180,000 pages.

Other  significant  holdings  on  the  Columbia  Accident  In-
vestigation  Board  Document  Database  Server  include  the 
Interview Database, which holds 287 documents compris-
ing  6,300  pages,  and  the  Investigative  Meeting  Minutes 
Database, which holds 72 documents totaling 598 pages. 

by NASA Ames Research Center. Access to Board files on 
Investigation  Organizer  was  restricted  to  Board  members 
and authorized staff. 

TechDoc

The  Board  drafted  its  final  report  with  the  assistance  of 
TechDoc,  a  secure  Web-based  file  management  program 
that allowed the 13 Board members and the editorial staff 
to comment on report drafts. TechDoc requires two-factor 
authentication and is certified to store sensitive Shuttle engi-
neering data that is governed by the International Traffic in 
Arms Reduction Treaty.

Concordance

Official Photographer

The  Board  employed  an  official  photographer,  who  took 
more than 5,000 digital images. These photographs, many 
of which have been electronically edited, document Board 
members and support staff at work in their offices and in the 
field in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Washing-
ton, D.C.; at Shuttle debris collection, analysis, and testing; 
and at public hearings, press briefings, and Congressional 
hearings. Images captured by NASA photographers relevant 
to  the  investigation  are  available  through  NASAʼs  Public 
Affairs Office.

National Archives and Records Administration

All appropriate Board documentation and products will be 
stored for submission to the National Archives and Records 
Administration, with the exception of documents originating 
in the Process-Based Mission Assurance system, which will 
be  archived  by  NASA  under  standard  agency  procedures. 
Representatives of the Board will review all documentation 
prior  to  its  transfer  to  the  National Archives  to  safeguard 
privacy and national security. This preparation will include a 
review of all documents to ensure compliance with the Free-
dom of Information Act, the Trade Secrets Act, the Privacy 
Act, the International Traffic in Arms Reduction Treaty, and 
Export Administration  Regulations.  To  gain  access  to  the 
Boardʼs documents, requests can be made to:

Acting on the recommendation of the Department of Justice, 
the Board selected Concordance as the software to manage 
all  the  electronic  documents  on  the  Columbia  Accident 
Investigation  Board  Database  Server.  Concordance  is  a 
full-text,  image-enabled  document  and  transcript  database 
accessible to authorized Board members on their office com-
puters. Concordance allowed the Board to quickly search the 
data provided by the Columbia Task Force, as well as any 
documents created and stored in the four other databases. 
The Concordance application was on a server in a secure 
location in the Board office. Though connected to the John-
son Space Center backbone, it was exclusively managed and 
administered by the Department of Justice and contract staff 
from  Aspen  Systems  Corporation.  Department  of  Justice 
and contract staff trained users to search the database, and 
performed  searches  at  the  request  of  Board  members  and 
investigators. The Department of Justice and contract staff 
also assisted Congressional representatives in accessing the 
Columbia Accident Investigation Board Database Server.

Investigation Database Tools

In addition to these databases, several information manage-
ment tools aided the Boardʼs investigation, deliberation, and 
report writing.

Group Systems

Group  Systems  is  a  collaborative  software  tool  that  orga-
nizes ideas and information by narrowing in on key issues 
and possible solutions. It supports academic, government, 
and commercial organizations worldwide. The Board used 
Group Systems primarily to brainstorm topics for inclusion 
in the report outline and to classify information related to 
the accident.

Investigation Organizer 

Investigation  Organizer  is  a  Web-based  pre-decisional 
management and modeling tool designed by NASA to sup-
port  mishap  investigation  teams.  Investigation  Organizer 
provides a central information repository that can be used 
by investigation teams to store digital products. The Board 
used Investigation Organizer to connect data from various 
sources to the outline that guided its investigation. Inves-
tigation Organizer was developed, maintained, and hosted
